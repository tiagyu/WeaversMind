1,1,Australia,,,,,,
1,2,favorite,,,"The word 'favorite' is the correct answer because the sentence is asking about someone's most preferred sport. 'Favorite' translates to 가장 좋아하는 in Korean, which aligns perfectly with the question. The option 'like' is a verb and doesn't fit grammatically, while 'best' refers to the highest quality rather than preference.",,,
1,3,planning to do,going to do,,"Both 'planning to do' and 'going to do' naturally fill in the blank. 'Going to do' is often used to express a planned future activity, and 'planning to do' is also acceptable as it suggests arranging for something. 'Will do' is less preferred because it does not fit as naturally in a casual inquiry about holiday plans.",,,
1,4,parks,,,,,,
1,5,study harder,,,"The sentence in Korean instructs someone to study diligently, which corresponds directly to the option 'study harder'. The other options ('watch TV' and 'sleep early') do not match the advice given in the Korean sentence.",,,
1,6,May,Can,,"Both 'May' and 'Can' are acceptable when asking for permission. 'May' is traditionally used for permission requests and sounds more formal, which directly corresponds with the meaning of asking if one is allowed to borrow a book. 'Can' is also commonly used in everyday conversation even though it technically refers to ability. 'Might' is less common and sounds overly formal or archaic in this context.",,,
1,7,great,,,,,,
1,8,Why,,,"The correct answer is 'Why' because the sentence 'Why are you late?' asks for a reason, which matches the response 'Because I missed the bus.' The other options 'What' and 'When' do not logically ask for a reason, making 'Why' the only appropriate choice.",,,
1,9,doctor,,,,,,
1,10,worry,fret,,"Both 'worry' and 'fret' can appropriately fill the blank in the sentence, as the phrase 'Don't worry' is the common, natural expression, while 'Don't fret' is a less common but acceptable alternative with a similar meaning. 'Stress' is not usually used in this type of encouragement phrase.",,,
1,11,What's your opinion on,What do you think of,How do you feel about,"All three options are grammatically correct and semantically appropriate in the context of asking about someone's viewpoint on the movie. 
 
 1. 'What's your opinion on' directly asks for one's viewpoint and is suitably formal, matching the Korean sentence's inquiry about thoughts regarding the movie. 
 
 2. 'What do you think of' is a commonly used, natural phrase for seeking someone's thoughts or impressions, which fits well with the casual context. 
 
 3. 'How do you feel about' focuses more on the emotional response but still is an acceptable way to ask for an opinion on the movie.
 
 Thus, all three options can be considered correct answers.",,,
1,12,must not use,,,,,,
1,13,try,,,,,,
1,14,isn't it,,,"The phrase 'isn't it' is the correct tag question in this context. In English, a statement like 'It’s a beautiful day' is commonly followed by 'isn't it' to confirm the statement, which aligns with the Korean sentence '오늘은 정말 아름다운 날이야, 그렇지?'. 'Is it' and 'aren't it' do not correctly form the tag question here.",,,
1,15,am,,,,,,
1,16,exploring,,,,,,
1,17,bought,,,,,,
1,18,offered,,,,,,
1,19,better,,,"The option 'better' is the correct answer because the sentence uses a comparative structure. 'Worked better than anyone else' properly compares her performance against others. The other options don't fit: 'more' doesn't accurately convey the qualitative comparison in this context, and 'good' is an adjective, not a comparative form.",,,
1,20,to admire paintings,,,The phrase 'to admire paintings' correctly uses the infinitive form to explain the purpose of visiting the gallery. 'For admire paintings' and 'at admire paintings' do not fit grammatically in this context.,,,
1,21,intriguing,,,,,,
1,22,have,,,,,,
1,23,can,,,,,,
1,24,exploring,,,"The correct answer is 'exploring' because the verb 'enjoy' is typically followed by a gerund form (-ing). 'Explored' is past tense and 'explore' is the base form, both of which do not fit grammatically in this sentence.",,,
1,25,to explore,,,,,,
1,26,that,,,,,,
1,27,turned,,,,,,
1,28,makes,,,,,,
1,29,Pleased,,,"The phrase 'Pleased to meet you' is a common, polite form of greeting, which aligns with the Korean sentence '만나서 반갑습니다.' The other options, 'Disappointed' and 'Upset', convey negative emotions that do not fit the context of a greeting.",,,
1,30,reading,,,,,,
1,31,travel,,,"The option 'travel' directly translates to 여행 in Korean, which matches the sentence '나는 여행할 거야.' The other options 'study' and 'cook' do not convey the meaning of going to travel.",,,
1,32,is interested in,,,,,,
1,33,needs to,has to,must,"All three options effectively express obligation or necessity, which matches the Korean sentence '그는 그의 일을 끝내야 한다.'
 
 1. 'needs to' suggests that it is necessary for him to finish his work.
 2. 'has to' implies that he is compelled or required to finish his work.
 3. 'must' indicates a strong obligation to finish his work.
 
 Because all three options convey similar meanings of necessity, each of them could be seen as a correct choice.",,,
1,34,try,,,,,,
1,35,good,,,,,,
1,36,tea,,,,,,
1,37,Because,,,,,,
1,38,amazing,incredible,,"Both 'amazing' and 'incredible' are commonly used exclamations that convey a strong sense of admiration or astonishment, which aligns with the Korean phrase '정말 놀랍다!'. 'Surprising' is less suitable because it often implies unexpectedness rather than the degree of awe expressed in the sentence.",,,
1,39,hear,,,,,,
1,40,help,,,,,,
1,41,doesn't she?,,,"The sentence 'She likes coffee, ___?' requires a tag question that corresponds to the simple present tense used in the main clause. Since the verb 'likes' employs the auxiliary 'does' in negative form, the correct tag is 'doesn't she?'. 'Isn't she?' incorrectly uses the auxiliary 'is', and 'don't they?' mismatches both the subject and the verb form.",,,
1,42,talk,,,"The phrase 'let's talk about history' is the most natural expression in English to match the intent of the Korean sentence '이제 역사에 대해 이야기해보자.' Although 'speak' can be used, 'speak about history' sounds less common in casual conversation. 'Discuss' typically does not pair with the preposition 'about' (as in 'discuss history' is preferred), making it less suitable in this context.",,,
1,43,blue stripes,,,"The Korean sentence specifies '파란 줄무늬' which directly translates to 'blue stripes'. Thus, option 2 'blue stripes' is the correct answer as it perfectly aligns with the given Korean description.",,,
1,44,the museum,,,,,,
1,45,chatting,,,,,,
1,46,gonna,going to,,"Both 'gonna' and 'going to' correctly convey future intent to visit the theme park. 'Going to' is grammatically standard while 'gonna' is a colloquial contraction that is also commonly understood as expressing a planned action. 'Go to' does not fit grammatically in the context. Thus, both 'gonna' and 'going to' are acceptable responses.",,,
1,47,that,,,,,,
1,48,to,,,,,,
1,49,and,,,,,,
1,50,too dark,,,"The sentence requires an adjective phrase to express intensity. 'Too dark' is the correct form to indicate an excessive level of darkness, which aligns with the Korean description '너무 어두워요'. 'To dark' is grammatically incorrect, and 'too darker' improperly compares and results in a double comparative form.",,,
1,51,was,,,,,,
1,52,tallest,,,"The superlative 'tallest' correctly corresponds to the Korean phrase '가장 높은', which means 'the highest'. 'Taller' is a comparative form and does not fit the context, and 'most tall' is not a standard construction.",,,
1,53,our smart classmate,,,"The use of 'our' is appropriate because the Korean sentence implies that the person being referred to is a classmate of the speaker and the listener (i.e., a member of their shared class). This common relationship makes 'our smart classmate' the best option. The alternatives 'my smart classmate' and 'your smart classmate' would indicate a singular personal relationship that does not necessarily involve both parties and therefore do not fit the context as well.",,,
1,54,to explore,,,,,,
1,55,must,,,,,,
1,56,refreshing,,,,,,
1,57,rings,,,,,,
1,58,give,,,,,,
1,59,doesn't it?,,,"The sentence 'This park looks so beautiful' is a positive statement, so the tag question should be negative. 'Doesn't it?' is the only option that correctly turns the statement into a negative tag, making it the suitable choice.",,,
1,60,one,,,,,,
1,61,Glad,Pleased,,"Both 'Glad' and 'Pleased' can be naturally used in the greeting '___ to meet you,' which corresponds to the Korean expression '만나서 반가워요.'
 
 1. 'Pleased to meet you' is a standard, formal greeting commonly used in English.
 2. 'Glad to meet you' is also acceptable and conveys a similar friendly sentiment.
 3. 'Happy to meet you' is less idiomatic in this context, as 'happy' is not typically used in greetings of this sort.
 
 Thus, both 'Glad' and 'Pleased' are valid choices.",,,
1,62,enjoy,,,,,,
1,63,Where's,,,,,,
1,64,reading,,,,,,
1,65,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' fit naturally in this context. 'Help' is the most common choice in everyday English and directly translates to the intended meaning. 'Assist' conveys the same meaning with a slightly more formal tone, which still works well in the sentence. 'Support' is less appropriate because it typically implies providing backing or resources rather than the direct, immediate action of helping someone with homework.",,,
1,66,take a break,,,,,,
1,67,studied,,,,,,
1,68,How,,,,,,
1,69,Seoul,,,,,,
1,70,should,,,,,,
1,71,interested,,,,,,
1,72,want,wish,,"Both 'want' and 'wish' express a desire which fits the meaning of the Korean sentence '나는 의사가 되고 싶어.'
 
 1. 'Want' is the most common and natural choice in everyday conversation, directly conveying a desire to become a doctor.
 2. 'Wish' is also grammatically correct and can be used to express a desire, albeit in a slightly more formal or traditional context.
 
 Thus, both 'want' and 'wish' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,73,gonna,going to,,"Both 'gonna' and 'going to' correctly indicate a future plan in informal speech. The sentence 'I'm going to visit my grandparents' supports the use of either option as they both convey future intention, while 'going into' is not grammatically appropriate in this context.",,,
1,74,wonderful,nice,,"Both 'wonderful' and 'nice' are acceptable choices to complete the greeting 'Have a ______ day!' as they naturally convey the intended meaning of '멋진 하루 보내세요!'. 'Wonderful' emphasizes a sense of excellence and beauty, while 'nice' is a common, friendly term. Both fit grammatically and contextually, making them the correct options.",,,
1,75,this book,,,,,,
1,76,agree,,,,,,
1,77,am,,,,,,
1,78,have,,,,,,
1,79,carefully,,,,,,
1,80,began,,,,,,
1,81,Singing,,,,,,
1,82,announce,,,"The sentence 'I want to ______ the event.' requires the base form of the verb after 'want to'. 'Announce' fits grammatically as it is the simple base form of the verb, whereas 'announcing' is a gerund form and 'announces' is the third person singular form.",,,
1,83,going to,,,The phrase 'going to' is commonly used to indicate future intention and fits naturally in the sentence 'We're going to explore hidden temples.' 'Going' without 'to' or 'goes to' does not correctly form the future intention construction in this context.,,,
1,84,that,,,,,,
1,85,like,,,,,,
1,86,am drawing,,,The correct answer is 'am drawing' because it correctly matches the subject 'I' with the proper form of the verb. 'Is drawing' and 'are drawing' are incorrect because they do not agree with 'I' in subject-verb agreement.,,,
1,87,will,,,,,,
1,88,is,,,"The verb 'is' correctly matches the singular noun 'book'. The sentence 'There is a colorful book on my desk.' is grammatically correct, while 'are' would be used for plural nouns and 'am' is not appropriate in this context.",,,

1,97,tall,,,,,,
1,98,tall,,,,,,
1,99,visited,traveled,,"Both 'visited' and 'traveled' fit naturally in the sentence and accurately convey the action of going to Japan. 'Visited' straightforwardly indicates that the person went to that location, while 'traveled' also implies the journey that ended in Japan. 'Swam' is not relevant in the context.",,,
1,100,restroom,,,,,,
1,101,going to,gonna,,"Both 'going to' and 'gonna' are appropriate choices in this sentence. The sentence 'I'm going to visit my grandparents' is grammatically correct and matches the future intention expressed in the Korean sentence. 'Gonna' is a colloquial contraction of 'going to', and it fits naturally in informal spoken English. On the other hand, 'will' would require the contraction 'I'll' to be grammatically acceptable in this context, so it is not chosen here.",,,
1,102,meet,,,,,,

1,106,this jacket,,,,,,
1,107,think,,,,,,
1,108,tell me more about,,,"The context of the conversation indicates that someone is asking for additional information about the school festival, which fits best with 'tell me more about'. The other options do not naturally match the invitation to provide further details about an event.",,,

1,119,suits,,,,,,
1,120,myself,,,"The pronoun 'myself' is the correct reflexive form used when the subject and the object refer to the same person. 'Me' would be the object of a verb, but not reflexive, and 'I' is the subject form, so they do not fit grammatically in 'I can see ___ in the mirror.'",,,
1,121,a few,,,,,,
1,122,was,,,,,,
1,123,have to,,,"The phrase 'You have to earn money when you want something special.' is grammatically correct. 'Must to' is incorrect due to the extra 'to', and 'has to' is not appropriate with 'you' as the subject.",,,
1,124,very,much,,"Both 'very' and 'much' can be used to intensify the comparative adjective 'spicier'.
 
 1. 'Much spicier' is a common phrase when comparing two items to emphasize a significant difference.
 2. 'Very spicier' is also acceptable for stressing the contrast, even though it is less commonly used with comparative adjectives than 'much'.
 3. 'More' is incorrect here because 'spicier' already functions as the comparative form of 'spicy'.",,,
1,125,peaceful,,,,,,
1,126,Hello,,,"The sentence starts with a greeting. 'Hello' is the appropriate greeting used for introductions. 'Goodbye' would be incorrect, and 'Welcome' does not fit in the context of introducing someone.",,,
1,127,favorite,,,,,,
1,128,Be careful,,,,,,
1,129,reading,,,,,,
1,130,open,,,,,,
1,131,Happy,Glad,,"Both 'Happy' and 'Glad' naturally complete the sentence '___ to hear that' and are commonly used in everyday conversation to express positive feelings upon hearing good news. Although 'Pleased' can also be used in more formal contexts, 'Happy' and 'Glad' more closely convey the casual tone implied by the Korean sentence '그 말을 들으니 다행이야', making them the most appropriate choices.",,,
1,132,going to,planning to,,"Both 'going to' and 'planning to' are grammatically acceptable and natural in the sentence structure. 
 1. 'Going to' fits directly with the answer 'I’m going to travel' and is commonly used to express future plans. 
 2. 'Planning to' also works well as it refers to preparing or intending to do something, which is consistent with making future arrangements. 
 'Will' is not appropriate because it doesn’t fit properly with the present continuous construction in the question.",,,
1,133,library,,,,,,
1,134,How old,,,,,,
1,135,I have no idea,,,,,,
1,136,don't you,,,"The sentence 'You like ice cream, ___?' requires a tag question that matches the subject 'you' and the main verb. 'Don't you' is the correct tag for a positive statement 'you like', making it the correct option. 'Aren't you' does not match the auxiliary form 'do' for the main clause, and 'isn't it' does not agree with the subject 'you'.",,,
1,137,cake,,,"The Korean sentence '케이크 좀 드실래요?' translates to 'Would you like some cake?', so the word 'cake' is the correct choice. 'Salad' and 'juice' do not match the Korean context, making 'cake' the only appropriate answer.",,,
1,138,worried about it,,,,,,
1,139,should eat,,,,,,
1,140,Wow!,,,,,,
1,141,take a class,,,,,,
1,142,is,,,,,,
1,143,helmet,,,,,,
1,144,helped,,,"The sentence is in the past tense, as indicated by the Korean statement '나는 소풍 동안 내 친구를 도왔어요.' Therefore, the past tense form 'helped' fits correctly. 'Help' is present tense and 'helps' is third-person singular present, so neither of them fits the context.",,,
1,145,will,,,"The word 'will' is the best fit because the sentence refers to a future action, which aligns with the Korean sentence that uses a future intention marker '방문할 거예요.'.
 1. 'Will' is commonly used in English to indicate a simple future event.
 2. 'Would' would imply a conditional or hypothetical context, which doesn’t match the definitive tone of the Korean sentence.
 3. 'Shall' is usually more formal or archaic and isn’t typically used in this context.",,,
1,146,higher,,,"The sentence compares two scores, and in comparative context, the adjective 'high' must be converted to its comparative form 'higher'. The option 'highest' is a superlative and does not fit the sentence structure, while 'high' is the base form and cannot be used to compare two items.",,,
1,147,to eat pizza tonight,,,,,,
1,148,to buy,,,"The phrase 'to buy' correctly expresses the purpose of saving money. In this context, it indicates the intention behind saving money, which matches the meaning of the Korean sentence. The other options do not naturally convey the idea of purpose in a grammatically correct manner.",,,
1,149,playing,,,,,,
1,150,reads,,,,,,
1,151,walking,,,"The correct answer is 'walking' because the sentence uses the present continuous tense ('am ___'), which requires the -ing form of the verb to express an ongoing action. 'Walk' is the base form and 'walked' is the past tense, neither of which fit grammatically with 'am'.",,,
1,152,looked,,,,,,
1,153,offer,,,,,,
1,154,toughest,,,,,,
1,155,isn't it,,,"The correct tag question for the sentence 'The sandwich tastes delicious' is 'isn't it?' because the adjective 'delicious' used with a singular subject (sandwich) takes the auxiliary 'is' in the tag. 'Doesn't it' would incorrectly use the auxiliary 'do', and 'won't it' is inappropriate for a stative condition.",,,
1,156,should water,,,"The sentence is stating a need or obligation expressed in a recommendation to water the plants for their growth. 'Should water' correctly expresses a suggestion or advice, matching the Korean sentence’s meaning (물 줘야 해요). 'Must water' implies a stronger, required obligation and 'could water' hints at possibility, which neither fits as naturally in this context.",,,
1,157,When,,,,,,
1,158,This,,,,,,
1,159,What's,How's,,"Both 'What's' and 'How's' can be used to ask about the current state of the weather in English. 'What's the weather today?' is commonly used to inquire about weather conditions, similar to asking 'What is the weather like today?'. 'How's the weather today?' directly asks about the condition of the weather, aligning well with the Korean question '오늘 날씨가 어때?'. 'Where's' is not appropriate because it asks about location. Therefore, both 'What's' and 'How's' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,160,TV,,,,,,
1,161,Stand in line,,,,,,
1,162,favorite,,,The word 'favorite' correctly translates the Korean meaning of '좋아하는' in the sentence. 'Ordinary' and 'boring' do not match the intended meaning of the sentence which indicates a preferred subject.,,,
1,163,going to,planning to,,"Both 'going to' and 'planning to' are appropriate in this context. The question implies a future activity with '할 거야', and both phrases convey a future plan. 'Going to' is commonly used for indicating future actions, while 'planning to' also fits as it suggests an arrangement of activities. 'Want to' is less appropriate as it would be grammatically incorrect in this sentence.",,,
1,164,help,,,,,,
1,165,get,,,,,,
1,166,What,,,"The correct answer is 'What' because the question asks for the activity performed yesterday, which is referenced by 'what'. 'Who' and 'When' do not match the context of the question.",,,
1,167,How long,,,,,,
1,168,this book,,,,,,
1,169,try,,,,,,
1,170,interested,,,,,,
1,171,wish,want,,"Both 'wish' and 'want' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Where do you wish to travel?' and 'Where do you want to travel?' are both grammatically correct and convey a desire to travel. 'Need' does not match the intended meaning of a desire, so it's excluded.",,,
1,172,How much,,,"The sentence is asking for the price of the shoes. 'How much' is used to inquire about the cost of items, which matches the given Korean sentence, while 'How many' is used for countable items and 'How long' is used for duration or length.",,,
1,173,like,,,,,,
1,174,am,,,,,,
1,175,finish,,,"The sentence uses the adverb 'always' which indicates habitual action, thus requiring the base form of the verb. 'Finish' is the simple present form that correctly fits the context. 'Finishes' would be used with a third person singular subject, and 'finished' is the past tense.",,,
1,176,am,,,,,,
1,177,There is,,,,,,
1,178,visited,,,,,,
1,179,visit,,,"The correct answer is 'visit' because the Korean sentence '나는 유명한 박물관을 방문하고 싶어요' directly translates to wanting to visit a museum. 'Visit' accurately conveys the meaning of '방문하다' (to visit). The other options do not match as naturally: 'see' generally implies viewing rather than entering, and 'go' lacks the necessary detail of visiting a specific place.",,,

1,193,Let's take a break,,,,,,
1,194,lend,give,,"Both 'lend' and 'give' can appropriately complete the sentence as they are used in common expressions for offering help. The idiom 'lend a hand' is widely recognized and directly corresponds to the intended meaning of offering help, while 'give you a hand' is also a valid, although slightly less conventional, variation that conveys the same idea. 'Offer' does not fit as naturally in the idiomatic expression.",,,
1,195,like music,,,,,,
1,196,tea,,,,,,
1,197,go for a walk,,,"The Korean sentence '산책하러 가는 게 어때?' translates to 'How about going for a walk?', which directly points to this action. The other options ('eat dinner' and 'drink coffee') do not match the suggestion made by the Korean sentence.",,,
1,198,are,,,,,,
1,199,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' appropriately fill in the blank in the sentence 'Can you ___ me?'.
 
 1. 'Help' is the most common and natural choice in everyday conversation when asking for aid, fitting the informal tone of the dialogue.
 2. 'Assist' is also grammatically correct and conveys a similar meaning, although it is slightly more formal, it still fits the context.
 3. 'Aid' is a correct synonym, but it is less commonly used in this conversational setting, which makes it a less likely choice compared to the other two options.",,,
1,200,love,enjoy,,"Both 'love' and 'enjoy' are grammatically correct and natural choices in the sentence ""I ____ painting."" 'I love painting' implies a deep affection or passion for painting, while 'I enjoy painting' indicates that painting is a pleasurable activity, which is consistent with the Korean sentence '나는 그림 그리기를 즐겨.' The word 'prefer' is less appropriate here because it implies a choice among alternatives, not a fondness for the activity.",,,
1,201,playing the piano,,,"The Korean sentence specifically mentions '피아노', which means piano. Therefore, the only option that correctly maps to this is 'playing the piano', making it the most suitable answer.",,,
1,202,read,,,,,,
1,203,study English,,,"The Korean sentence specifies 영어를 공부하니, which means 'to study English'. 'Study English' is the direct translation and fits naturally with the context, whereas 'read English' and 'watch English' do not match the intended meaning.",,,
1,204,worried,,,"The Korean sentence '내 시험에 대해 걱정하고 있어' directly translates to being worried about the test. 'Worried' accurately conveys the notion of concern expressed in the Korean sentence. 'Nervous' might imply anxiety or jitters but does not match the precise meaning of '걱정하다' as well as 'worried' does, and 'excited' is clearly inappropriate.",,,
1,205,take a break,,,,,,
1,206,write,,,,,,
1,207,enjoying,,,,,,
1,208,helped,,,"The correct answer is 'helped' because the speaker describes a completed action in the past as indicated by 'I just ___ my neighbor.' In English, using 'helped' in the past tense perfectly matches the context of having already provided assistance, which aligns with the Korean sentence '저는 방금 이웃을 도와줬어요.' The other options don't properly convey a completed action.",,,
1,209,pass,,,"The base form 'pass' is used to give commands in imperatives. 'Passes' is incorrect because it is a third-person singular form, and 'passing' is a gerund, which does not fit the context of a command.",,,
1,210,myself,,,,,,
1,211,must,,,,,,
1,212,was,,,,,,
1,213,cheerful,,,,,,
1,214,finish,,,,,,
1,215,to spend,,,,,,
1,216,creative,,,,,,
1,217,to celebrate,,,,,,
1,218,as deep as,as deeply as,,"Both 'as deep as' and 'as deeply as' can be used in this sentence. The Korean sentence implies a comparison regarding the extent (depth) of swimming, and both options convey that meaning. 'As deep as' uses the adjective 'deep' which can function adverbially in such comparative constructions, while 'as deeply as' uses the proper adverb 'deeply' to modify the verb 'swim'. 'Deeper than' is incorrect because it introduces a comparative structure that does not match the original sentence's meaning.",,,
1,219,to play,playing,,"Both 'to play' and 'playing' can correctly complete the sentence. In English, the verb 'start' can be followed by either the infinitive form or the gerund without a significant change in meaning. 'Started playing the guitar' is the more common collocation, but 'started to play the guitar' is also grammatically acceptable. The option 'played' is incorrect because it does not fit the structure required after 'started'.",,,
1,220,most beautiful,,,,,,
1,221,smiled,,,"The sentence is in the past tense context as indicated by 'When I heard the good news', so the correct form is 'smiled'. 'Smile' would be present tense, and 'smiling' is a participle, neither of which fit the past tense context.",,,
1,222,doing,,,,,,
1,223,That,This,,"Both 'That' and 'This' can be used in introductions to refer to a person when introducing someone. 'That' is common in contexts where the speaker points out a person, while 'This' is also acceptable when introducing someone who is present. 'Here' is not suitable because it indicates a location rather than identifying a person.",,,
1,224,happy,,,"The option 'happy' best fits the meaning of the Korean sentence which asks if one is satisfied with their new job. 'Excited' implies anticipation or eagerness, which is not as directly related to satisfaction as 'happy' is, and 'sad' contradicts the sentiment expressed in the question.",,,
1,225,favorite,,,,,,
1,226,interested,,,"The word 'interested' is the appropriate choice as it directly corresponds with the response provided ('Yes, I’m interested in playing the piano') and matches the Korean sentence asking if someone is interested in music. The other options, 'excited' and 'curious', do not fit the context as naturally.",,,

1,234,think,,,,,,
1,235,Why,,,,,,
1,236,will buy,am going to buy,,"Both 'will buy' and 'am going to buy' appropriately indicate a future intention that matches the Korean sentence ‘나는 새 휴대폰을 살 거야,’ which expresses a plan to purchase a new phone. The simple present 'buy' does not reflect the intended future purchase.",,,
1,237,good,,,,,,
1,238,am,,,,,,
1,239,enjoy,,,,,,
1,240,played,,,,,,
1,241,can,,,,,,
1,242,to try,trying,,"Both 'to try' and 'trying' are grammatically acceptable choices in the sentence.
 
 1. 'I love to try new dishes' is a correct structure often used to express a habitual action or general preference.
 2. 'I love trying new dishes' is also natural and conveys the same meaning by using the gerund form.
 3. 'Try new dishes' without any additional infinitive marker or gerund is ungrammatical in this context.
 
 Thus, both 'to try' and 'trying' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,243,watching,,,,,,
1,244,because,,,"The sentence explains the reason for the festival's popularity, so 'because' is the appropriate conjunction to link the cause (vibrant costumes) with the result (popularity). 'Although' and 'however' would indicate a contrast, which does not match the meaning.",,,
1,245,was,,,,,,
1,246,looked,,,,,,
1,247,How spicy,,,"The phrase 'How spicy' is grammatically correct and naturally asks about the degree of spiciness, which corresponds to the Korean sentence asking how spicy the curry is. 'What spicy' and 'How spice' are grammatically incorrect in this context.",,,
1,248,friendlier,more friendly,,"The sentence requires a comparative form to compare the cat and the dog. Both 'friendlier' and 'more friendly' are valid comparative forms. 'Friendlier' is the regular comparative form, while 'more friendly' uses the 'more' construction. 'Friendly' is not a comparative form and does not work in a comparison.",,,
1,249,aren't they?,,,"The sentence is a tag question where the main statement is positive, so a negative tag is used. 'Aren't they?' is the correct negative tag that aligns with the subject 'my classmates.' The other options, 'are they?' and 'isn't it?' do not properly match the response to a positive statement in a tag question format.",,,
1,250,made,,,,,,
1,251,going,doing,,"Both 'going' and 'doing' fit the idiomatic expression used in greetings. 'How are you doing?' is a common expression in American English, and 'How are you going?' is used informally in Australian English. 'Being' does not fit naturally in this context.",,,
1,252,This,,,,,,
1,253,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' naturally complete the sentence 'Can you ___ me, please?' and are synonyms that mean to give aid. 
 1. 'Help' is the most common and natural verb used in everyday English for offering aid. 
 2. 'Assist' is also correct, though it is slightly more formal. 
 3. 'Support' typically implies providing continual or emotional backing rather than direct aid in a one-time situation, so it is less appropriate here.",,,
1,254,Thank you,,,,,,
1,255,favorite,,,,,,
1,256,Do you want,Would you like,,"Both 'Do you want' and 'Would you like' can be used to offer something like cake. 'Would you like' is more formal and polite, aligning well with the Korean polite form '드실래요?', while 'Do you want' is acceptable in more casual contexts. 'Could you try' does not fit because it is used to ask for an attempt rather than to offer something.",,,
1,257,matter,,,,,,
1,258,hear,,,,,,
1,259,on the table,,,,,,
1,260,reading,,,The continuous progressive form 'is reading' is needed to form the present continuous tense which correctly translates to '읽고 있어요' in Korean. 'Read' and 'reads' do not grammatically fit this construction.,,,
1,261,go to the park,,,,,,
1,262,Sit,,,,,,
1,263,interested,,,,,,
1,264,plan to be,want to be,,"Both 'plan to be' and 'want to be' are appropriate in this context.
 
 1. 'Want to be' is the most straightforward option as it directly corresponds to the speaker's declaration 'I want to be a doctor.'
 2. 'Plan to be' also fits because it suggests a future intention, matching the question 'What do you ___ in the future?'
 3. 'Will be' is not grammatically correct in this construction as it would require rephrasing the sentence (e.g., 'What will you be in the future?').",,,
1,265,Which,,,,,,
1,266,late,,,,,,
1,267,beautiful,,,"The Korean sentence praises the picture as being very beautiful, making 'beautiful' the logical choice to fill in the blank. 'Ugly' and 'old' do not convey the intended compliment.",,,
1,268,going to,gonna,,"Both 'going to' and 'gonna' naturally complete the sentence 'What are you ____ do this weekend?' to express a planned future action. 'Going to' is the standard form, while 'gonna' is a colloquial contraction of 'going to', making both acceptable choices for the casual context implied by the Korean sentence. 'Will' does not work because the sentence structure 'What are you will do' is grammatically incorrect.",,,

1,271,cozy,,,,,,
1,272,am,,,,,,
1,273,is chasing,,,,,,
1,274,turn off,,,,,,
1,275,to be,to become,,"Both 'to be' and 'to become' are grammatically correct in the sentence 'I hope ___ a famous writer.' 'To be' expresses the state of being a famous writer and is commonly used, while 'to become' emphasizes the process of attaining that status. 'Become' (without 'to') is not grammatically appropriate in this context.",,,
1,276,colder,,,,,,
1,277,shows,,,,,,
1,278,am not,,,"The grammatically correct response to 'Are you curious about new classes? - No, I ___.' is 'am not'.
 
 1. 'Am not' is the proper negative form for the first person singular ('I am not').
 2. 'Ain't' is considered informal and non-standard, and may not be acceptable in formal contexts.
 3. 'Isn't' would be used with the third person singular, not with 'I', making it incorrect.",,,
1,279,doesn't,,,,,,
1,280,can,,,,,,
1,281,organized,,,,,,
1,282,looked,,,,,,
1,283,when,,,,,,
1,284,Planning,,,"The correct answer is 'Planning' because in this sentence, the gerund form acts as the subject. 'Plan' is a noun, but it does not convey the meaning of the process, and 'Planned' is a past participle and does not correctly express the ongoing process described in the sentence.",,,
1,285,because,,,"The word 'because' correctly indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between the balloon being filled with helium and its rising. 'If' would imply a condition that isn't appropriate in context, and 'although' would introduce a contrast rather than a reason.",,,
1,286,beautiful,,,,,,
1,287,will,,,,,,
1,288,This,He,,"Both 'This' and 'He' can appropriately fill the blank in the sentence when referring to a person. 'This is my brother, Jake.' is a common way to introduce someone directly, especially when the person is present or being introduced. 'He is my brother, Jake.' can also be correct in contexts where the subject is already known or has been referenced. 'That' is less appropriate here because it tends to be used for pointing out someone who is not as immediately present or when the reference is more distant in context.",,,
1,289,Who,,,,,,
1,290,Can,,,,,,
1,291,Why,,,,,,
1,292,Would,,,,,,
1,293,favorite,,,The word 'favorite' fits the sentence because the quiz and its Korean translation are asking for the color that one likes the most. 'Famous' and 'fantastic' do not convey the sense of personal preference that is required in this context.,,,
1,294,What,,,,,,
1,295,How,,,"The phrase 'How did you like the movie?' is the natural, idiomatic way to ask someone's opinion about the movie. 'What did you like' would change the meaning of the question, focusing on specifics the person liked, and 'Where did you like' is grammatically incorrect in this context.",,,
1,296,going,,,,,,
1,297,get,go,,"Both 'get' and 'go' correctly complete the sentence to ask for directions to the train station. 'How can I get to the train station?' is a common and idiomatic way to ask for directions, while 'How can I go to the train station?' also makes sense grammatically. 'Find' does not fit the context, as it implies locating the station rather than reaching it by travel.",,,
1,298,May,Can,,"Both 'May' and 'Can' are commonly used to ask for permission. 'May' is traditionally correct for asking permission, while 'Can' is frequently used in casual conversation. 'Would' does not fit naturally in this context as it is not typically used to request permission.",,,
1,299,to,,,,,,
1,300,want,,,,,,
1,301,should,,,,,,
1,302,more interesting,,,"The sentence is making a comparison between two books. 'More interesting' is the correct comparative form of 'interesting', which is needed to express that one book is more interesting than another. 'Interesting' is an adjective without a comparative form, and 'interestinger' is not a valid form in English.",,,
1,303,Why,,,,,,
1,304,am,,,,,,
1,305,plays,,,,,,
1,306,are,,,,,,
1,307,can,,,"The sentence describes the ability to run faster, which is correctly expressed by 'can'. 'Could' suggests a conditional or past ability, and 'should' implies obligation or recommendation. Therefore, 'can' is the most appropriate option.",,,

1,315,is,,,,,,
1,316,to,,,,,,
1,317,bought,,,,,,
1,318,has,,,"The option 'has' is correct because the sentence requires a form of 'to have' in the construction 'has to' to express obligation. 'Have' does not match the subject 'she', and 'had' would imply a past obligation, so 'has' is the proper choice.",,,
1,319,should,,,"The correct answer is 'should' because the sentence in Korean, '당신은 채소를 더 많이 먹어야 해요.', implies a recommendation or advice, which translates to 'should' in English. 'Would' and 'can' do not convey the same sense of obligation or recommendation.",,,
1,320,rains,,,,,,
1,321,cheaper,,,,,,
1,322,most,,,,,,
1,323,How's,,,,,,
1,324,favorite,,,"The word 'favorite' correctly completes the sentence, as the Korean sentence asks for someone's most liked or preferred food. 'Best' implies superiority in quality rather than personal preference, and 'ordinary' does not match the context.",,,
1,325,exercise,,,,,,
1,326,join,,,,,,
1,327,thrilled,happy,,"Both 'thrilled' and 'happy' correctly convey the sense of being very pleased, as indicated by the Korean phrase '난 정말 기뻐,' which means 'I’m really happy.' 'Annoyed' is inappropriate because it expresses a negative sentiment.",,,
1,328,happy,,,,,,
1,329,going to,planning to,,"Both 'going to' and 'planning to' naturally indicate a future plan, which corresponds to the Korean sentence asking about someone's plans for the weekend. 'Going to' is commonly used for expressing future activities while 'planning to' also implies having made arrangements or intentions for the future. 'Willing to' does not fit because it implies a readiness or consent rather than a planned action.",,,
1,330,looking forward,,,The phrase 'looking forward' correctly completes the sentence as part of the common expression 'looking forward to' that means '기대되다' in Korean. The other options do not fit grammatically in the sentence.,,,
1,331,Can,May,,"Both 'Can' and 'May' work well in this context. 'May I leave early?' is the traditionally correct form for asking permission and aligns perfectly with the polite nature of the Korean sentence. However, 'Can I leave early?' is also commonly used in everyday conversation to request permission. 'Might' is generally not used in this context.",,,
1,332,must not,cannot,,"Both 'must not' and 'cannot' are valid in this context. 'Must not' is a strong modal verb that directly indicates prohibition, which matches the Korean sentence stating that smoking is forbidden. 'Cannot' also implies that smoking is not allowed due to rules or regulations, making it acceptable here. On the other hand, 'should not' merely suggests that it is unadvisable, which is less forceful and not appropriate for a prohibition sign.",,,
1,333,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' naturally fit in the sentence 'Can you please ___ me with this?'. 'Help' is the common, everyday term, while 'assist' provides a more formal equivalent. The option 'support' is less natural in this specific construction.",,,

1,341,walked,,,,,,
1,342,discovering,,,"The word 'discovering' is correct because after the verb 'enjoyed', a gerund should be used as the object. 'Discover' is an infinitive which doesn’t fit, and 'discovered' is in the past tense, which does not match with the gerund form generally used after the verb 'enjoyed'.",,,

1,354,grew,,,"The sentence describes a change in the weather that happened in the past. 'Grew' is the correct past tense form to match the narrative of the sentence ('It grew chilly, and it started to snow'). 'Grow' is the base form and 'grows' is the third person singular in the present tense, neither of which fit the context.",,,

1,360,want to be,,,,,,
1,361,Will you,Can you,,"Both 'Will you' and 'Can you' are used to make polite requests in English, and they fit naturally in the sentence '______ do me a favor?'.
 
 1. 'Can you' is very common in everyday requests, asking if the person is able to perform the favor.
 2. 'Will you' is also acceptable, as it asks if the person is willing to help, fitting the context of a request.
 3. 'Should you' does not fit the context as it implies a different connotation.
 
 Thus, both 'Will you' and 'Can you' are appropriate choices.",,,
1,362,help,,,,,,
1,363,going to,,,,,,
1,364,great,,,,,,
1,365,do you want to,would you like to,,"Both 'do you want to' and 'would you like to' grammatically fill the blank and convey the intended meaning of the question '뭐 먹고 싶어?'.
 
 1. 'do you want to' directly asks about someone's desire, matching the informal tone of the Korean sentence.
 2. 'would you like to' is a slightly more polite form but still correctly asks about a desire for eating something.
 3. 'can you' does not appropriately address the question as it typically inquires about ability rather than desire.",,,
1,366,going for a walk,,,"The Korean sentence 번역 is asking about going for a walk (산책하러 가는 것은 어때요?), so 'going for a walk' is the natural fit. 'Going to run' and 'going for a swim' do not match the context of taking a walk.",,,

1,375,to,,,,,,
1,376,smell,,,"The correct choice is 'smell' because 'these spicy dumplings' is a plural subject and the sentence is in the present tense. 'Smells' would require a singular subject and 'smelled' would indicate past tense, neither of which match the intended meaning in the quiz.",,,
1,377,more,,,,,,
1,378,send,,,"The correct answer is 'send' because when using the future tense with 'will', the verb should be in its base form. 'Sends' is the third person singular form and 'sending' is a present participle, neither of which is appropriate in this sentence.",,,
1,379,sing,,,,,,
1,380,briskly,,,"The sentence 'Walk ___ in the park.' is an imperative sentence instructing someone to walk quickly. 'Briskly' is an adverb and properly modifies the verb 'walk' to indicate the manner of walking, which aligns with the Korean instruction '공원에서 빨리 걸으세요.' Although 'brisk' is an adjective that can describe a noun (e.g., 'a brisk walk'), in this imperative construction an adverb is required, making 'briskly' the correct choice.",,,
1,381,singing,,,,,,
1,382,is,,,"The sentence 'There is an old library in our town.' correctly uses 'is' to indicate the existence of a single entity (the old library) in a particular place. 'Are' would be used for plural subjects, and 'have' does not fit grammatically in this sentence.",,,
1,383,is,,,,,,
1,384,playing,,,,,,
1,385,30,,,,,,
1,386,that,,,,,,
1,387,This is,,,"The phrase 'This is' is used for introducing someone and fits the context of saying 'This is Anna, my friend.' 'That is' is less natural when making introductions and 'These are' is used for plural subjects.",,,
1,388,love,like,enjoy,"All three options can be used naturally in the sentence ""I ___ playing soccer."" 
 
 1. 'Like' directly translates the Korean '좋아해' and is the most literal match.
 2. 'Love' while a stronger emotion, is still commonly used in casual speech to express a fondness for an activity.
 3. 'Enjoy' also fits well because it conveys a sense of pleasure derived from playing soccer.
 
 Thus, all three options are acceptable answers.",,,
1,389,reading,,,,,,
1,390,touch,,,,,,
1,391,How was,,,"The correct choice is 'How was' because the question is inquiring about the overall experience of the trip in the past tense. 'How did' would typically require a following verb such as 'go', and 'How is' is in the present tense which does not match the context of the past experience described by 'It was amazing.'",,,
1,392,visited,,,,,,
1,393,interested,,,,,,
1,394,going,,,"The phrase 'How about going to the park?' is grammatically correct because 'how about' is typically followed by a gerund form of the verb. 'Going' fits naturally in this structure, unlike 'go' or 'goes', which do not work in this context.",,,

1,404,understand,,,,,,
1,405,visited,,,"The sentence refers to a completed action in the past, which is indicated by 'last week'. 'Visited' is the correct past tense form to match this context, while 'visits' and 'visit' are present tense forms and do not fit the time frame provided.",,,
1,406,To volunteer,Volunteering,,"Both 'To volunteer' and 'Volunteering' work as the subject of the sentence and correctly refer to the act of engaging in volunteer work, which aligns with the Korean sentence meaning. 'Volunteered' is not appropriate here as it is used in the past tense, whereas the sentence requires a form that represents the general activity or purpose. Thus, both 'To volunteer' and 'Volunteering' are acceptable choices.",,,
1,407,Exploring new ideas,To explore new ideas,,"Both 'Exploring new ideas' and 'To explore new ideas' function as the subject of the sentence and can grammatically fill the blank. 'Exploring new ideas' uses a gerund form which matches the original Korean sentence structure more naturally, while 'To explore new ideas' is an infinitive form that is also acceptable in English as a subject. 'To testing new ideas' is incorrect because it combines the infinitive marker 'to' with the gerund 'testing', making it ungrammatical.",,,
1,408,dances,,,,,,
1,409,quieter,,,"Since the sentence compares two cities, the adjective should be in its comparative form. 'Quieter' is the correct form for comparing two things, while 'quiet' is the base form and 'quietest' is the superlative form used for comparing three or more items.",,,
1,410,gave,,,,,,
1,411,sing,,,,,,
1,412,is studying,,,"The Korean sentence '내 여동생은 영어 공부를 하고 있어요.' uses the present continuous form to indicate that the action is currently in progress. 'Is studying' correctly reflects the ongoing nature of the activity, while 'studies' would imply a habitual action and 'study' is grammatically incorrect with the singular subject 'My sister'.",,,
1,413,will,,,,,,
1,414,are,,,,,,
1,415,myself,,,,,,
1,416,should,,,,,,
1,417,most colorful,,,"The correct answer is 'most colorful' because the sentence requires a superlative form to compare India with all other countries. 'More colorful' is a comparative, not a superlative, and 'colorfulest' is not a proper English word.",,,
1,418,to help the Earth,,,"The phrase 'to help the Earth' correctly conveys the purpose for which she carries her reusable bottle. It fits naturally into the sentence structure as it indicates a reason or intention ('with her to help the Earth').
 
 1. 'Helping the Earth' (Option 1) would be more suitable as a gerund phrase in a different construction, but it doesn’t integrate as seamlessly here.
 2. 'Help the Earth' (Option 3) lacks the necessary infinitive form to express purpose in this context.",,,
1,419,What,,,The sentence 'What is your name?' is the standard interrogative form in English when asking for someone's name. 'Who is your name?' and 'Where is your name?' do not fit grammatically or semantically in this context.,,,
1,420,enjoy,like,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' are natural choices in this context. 'What sport do you like?' is the most direct translation of the Korean sentence and aligns with the response 'I like soccer.' Meanwhile, 'What sport do you enjoy?' is also acceptable and commonly used to ask about someone's preferences. 'Prefer' is less suitable here because it would typically be paired with a different response (e.g., 'I prefer soccer') to reflect a choice between alternatives.",,,
1,421,doing,,,,,,
1,422,good at,,,,,,
1,423,Can I,May I,,"Both 'Can I' and 'May I' can be used when asking permission, and they both fit naturally into the sentence. 'Can I' is commonly used in everyday conversation even though it originally refers to ability, while 'May I' is more formally correct when asking for permission. 'Might I' is less common and sounds overly tentative in this context.",,,
1,424,touch,,,,,,
1,425,help,,,,,,
1,426,support,help,,"Both 'support' and 'help' fit naturally in the sentence 'Thank you for your ____.' The Korean sentence implies gratitude for received assistance. 'Help' directly translates to '도움' and is the most common usage, while 'support' is also acceptable as it conveys a similar meaning. 'Assist' is less suitable because it is rarely used as a noun in this context.",,,
1,427,try,,,"The word 'try' accurately reflects the meaning of '시도해보지 않아', which implies making an attempt or experiment with something. The other options do not convey the same nuance: 'do this' is too general and 'make this' is not used in this context.",,,
1,428,going to,,,,,,
1,429,happy,,,,,,
1,430,happy,,,,,,
1,431,like,love,,"Both 'like' and 'love' work well in the sentence to express a desire to travel the world. 'I'd like to travel the world' is a common expression indicating willingness or preference, and 'I'd love to travel the world' adds extra enthusiasm about the idea. 'Wish' is less natural in this context because 'I wish to travel the world' isn't typically used in casual conversation to express an aspiration in the same manner.",,,
1,432,good,,,,,,
1,433,think,,,,,,
1,434,late,,,"The answer 'late' is the only option that appropriately fits the context of the conversation. The question 'Why are you ____?' asks for a reason related to a time frame, and the explanation 'Because I missed the bus' indicates a delay, making 'late' the only logical and grammatically correct choice.",,,

1,446,when I visited the museum.,while I visited the museum.,,"Both 'when I visited the museum.' and 'while I visited the museum.' indicate the time at which the event happened and can be appropriately used in the sentence. 'When' directly translates to '했을 때' in the Korean sentence, and 'while' also suggests that both actions occurred simultaneously. The option 'if I visited the museum.' is not appropriate because it implies a conditional scenario rather than a past event.",,,
1,447,look,,,,,,
1,448,told,,,"The sentence 'My friend told me a funny story.' correctly uses the past tense verb 'told' to indicate that the friend narrated the story as a completed action. 'Tells' would imply a habitual present action, which does not fit the context, and 'tell' is not grammatically correct in this sentence structure.",,,

1,456,wrong,happening,,"Both 'wrong' and 'happening' work naturally in the sentence. 'What's wrong?' is a common expression used to inquire about someone's distress, and 'What's happening?' can also be used to ask if something unusual is occurring that might be causing upset. 'Missing' does not fit the context.",,,
1,457,Where,,,,,,
1,458,wait,,,,,,
1,459,don’t,,,,,,
1,460,don’t,,,"The phrase 'Why don’t you go to the park?' is a common suggestion, asking why the person is not going. The other two options do not fit the intended suggestion tone implied in the Korean sentence '공원에 가는 게 어때?'.",,,

1,466,like,,,,,,
1,467,is,,,,,,
1,468,There is,,,"The correct choice is 'There is' because the sentence in Korean indicates the existence of a single cat under the table. 'There are' is used for plural subjects and 'There was' would indicate past tense, which does not match the present tense context of the sentence.",,,

1,474,should,must,,"Both 'should' and 'must' express obligation which fits the meaning of the Korean sentence, '당신은 채소를 더 많이 먹어야 해요.' 'Should' offers a mild recommendation, while 'must' conveys a stronger sense of necessity. 'Can' does not imply obligation and therefore is incorrect.",,,
1,475,to visit,,,,,,
1,476,when,,,,,,
1,477,more,,,"The sentence is making a comparison between two books, which requires the comparative form. 'More interesting' is the correct form to indicate a higher degree of interest compared to that one. 'Most interesting' is a superlative, and 'very' is an intensifier that cannot be used in a comparative construction.",,,
1,478,best,,,,,,
1,479,interested in,,,,,,
1,480,can,may,,"Both 'can' and 'may' are used to ask for permission in English, though 'may' is considered more formal. In this context, where the speaker is asking if it is acceptable to leave early, both options are commonly accepted, making them both possible answers. 'Must' is not appropriate here as it implies obligation rather than permission.",,,
1,481,You'd better,,,"The phrase 'You'd better' is used to give advice or recommendations, which fits the context of the Korean sentence, '우산을 가져가는 게 좋겠어', implying that it would be a good idea to take an umbrella. 'You will' and 'You must' do not convey the same advisory nuance.",,,
1,482,suggest,recommend,,"Both 'suggest' and 'recommend' can appropriately fill the blank in the sentence, as the Korean sentence '뭐를 추천해요?' implies asking for a recommendation. 'Recommend' directly translates to 추천하다, which is a common usage in such contexts, while 'suggest' can also be used to imply advising or putting forward an option. 'Order' does not fit this context.",,,
1,483,traveled abroad,,,,,,
1,484,sustainable,,,"The word 'sustainable' is the correct answer because it directly corresponds to the meaning 'something that can last for a long time' as indicated in both the English quiz and the Korean translation. 'Temporary' means short-lived, and 'renewable' means able to be renewed, neither of which directly fits the definition provided.",,,
1,485,worried,,,"The sentence 'I'm ______ about my test results.' corresponds to expressing an emotion of concern or anxiety. In Korean, '내 시험 결과에 대해 걱정하고 있어' translates to 'I'm worried about my test results.' Thus, 'worried' is the most appropriate word for this sentence, fitting both the grammatical structure and the context.",,,

1,489,planning,,,,,,
1,490,How long does it take,How much time does it take,,"Both 'How long does it take' and 'How much time does it take' naturally ask for the duration of a trip and align with the reply 'It takes about three hours.'
 
 1. 'How long does it take' is the most common and idiomatic way to ask about duration, matching the Korean query directly.
 2. 'How much time does it take' is also grammatically and semantically correct and can be used interchangeably with 'How long does it take.'
 
 Although 'How many hours does it take' would also imply duration, it is less flexible because it assumes the answer is strictly in hours. Therefore, the first two options are the most natural and suitable choices.",,,
1,491,good at playing the guitar,,,"The Korean sentence translates to 'I am good at playing the guitar.', which directly corresponds to the phrase 'good at playing the guitar.' The other options do not match as they either indicate a negative skill level or refer to playing drums, which is not mentioned in the Korean sentence.",,,
1,492,need,have,,"Both 'need' and 'have' work in the sentence and convey the sense of requirement implied by the Korean sentence '내가 무엇을 할 필요가 있나요?'.
 
 1. 'What do I need to do?' directly uses 'need' to express necessity.
 2. 'What do I have to do?' uses 'have' in the construction 'have to' which also means 'must' or 'need to'.
 
 Both options are grammatically correct and natural, whereas 'should' does not fit in this context.",,,

1,496,are,,,,,,
1,497,that,,,"The option 'that' is the correct relative pronoun to connect the clause specifying the gift. 'Whom' is used for people and does not refer to an object, while 'whose' is possessive and not appropriate for referring to an inanimate noun like 'gift'.",,,

1,504,moved,,,"The sentence requires a past participle form to complete the passive construction, indicating that the subject experienced the emotion as a result of an act. 'Moved' is the correct answer because it correctly forms the past passive ('I was moved') and fits grammatically. 'Move' is a base form and 'moving' is a present participle, both of which do not suit the passive past context.",,,
1,505,where the best viewpoint is,,,"The sentence 'I wonder where the best viewpoint is' correctly uses an indirect question structure, which is required after 'I wonder.' Option 1 incorrectly retains a direct question format, and Option 3 has an improper word order.",,,

1,513,heard,,,"The word 'heard' is commonly used when asking if someone has come across information or news about something. In this context, it fits naturally with the dialogue and the Korean translation, which is asking if the person has heard about the new movie. The other options do not match as appropriately.",,,
1,514,confident,sure,,"Both 'confident' and 'sure' are appropriate in this context. 'Are you sure about your answer?' is the most common and idiomatic way to ask the question, matching the Korean sentence well. 'Are you confident about your answer?' is also acceptable as it inquires about one's self-assurance regarding the response. 'Certain' sounds less natural in this particular question format.",,,

1,521,mustn't,shouldn't,,"Both 'mustn't' and 'shouldn't' work in this sentence. 'Mustn't' expresses a strong prohibition, implying that eating too much junk food is not allowed, while 'shouldn't' gives a recommendation or advice against it. The Korean sentence '너는 정크푸드를 너무 많이 먹으면 안 돼.' can be interpreted as a prohibition or advice, making both options acceptable.",,,
1,522,loud,,,,,,
1,523,What,Which,,"Both 'What' and 'Which' can appropriately fill the blank in the sentence. 'What movie do you watch on weekends?' is commonly used to ask in a general sense about the type or title of the movie, while 'Which movie do you watch on weekends?' might be used when the speaker assumes there is a specific set of movies in consideration. 'Who' is not appropriate since the question is about a movie, not a person.",,,

1,540,What kind of,,,"The phrase 'What kind of' correctly asks about the type or category of music, which aligns with the Korean question asking for a kind of music. 'How much' refers to quantity and 'How often' refers to frequency, neither of which fit the context.",,,
1,541,next to,,,,,,
1,542,reach,get to,,Both 'reach' and 'get to' sound natural in the context of asking for directions to a location. 'Reach' is commonly used in questions about arriving at a destination and 'get to' fits well with the implied meaning of the Korean sentence asking for how to go to the train station. 'Go to' is less appropriate here because it is redundant when asking for directions.,,,
1,543,How much,,,,,,
1,544,15% off,,,,,,
1,545,look like,,,,,,
1,546,describe,tell me more about,,Both 'describe' and 'tell me more about' are valid options in this context. 'Tell me more about' directly matches the Korean sentence which asks for more information about the event. 'Describe' is also acceptable as it invites someone to provide details about the event. 'Explain' is less natural here as it might be interpreted as needing a justification or clarification rather than a general overview.,,,
1,547,What's wrong?,,,"The phrase 'What's wrong?' perfectly fits the context where someone is expressing discomfort by saying 'I have a stomachache.' It naturally inquires about what is wrong, matching the Korean expression '무슨 일이야?'. The other options do not directly address someone feeling unwell.",,,
1,548,Make sure,Don't forget,,"Both 'Make sure' and 'Don't forget' serve as effective reminders appropriate for the instruction '나가기 전에 불을 꼭 끄세요.' The expression 'Make sure' implies ensuring that the action is completed, while 'Don't forget' directly warns not to overlook the action. 'Check that' does not convey a strong imperative reminder as clearly as the other two options.",,,
1,549,planning,going to,,"Both 'planning' and 'going to' fit naturally in the sentence with the intended meaning. The Korean sentence indicates that the speaker has a plan to visit their grandparents. 'Planning' directly conveys that the visit is arranged, while 'going to' implies a future action that has been decided. 'Thinking of' is less strong in terms of decision and planning, making it a less suitable choice.",,,
1,550,Where and when,What time and where,,Both 'Where and when' and 'What time and where' are acceptable answers. The Korean sentence '언제 어디서 만날까요?' refers to asking about both the time and place of meeting. 'What time and where' directly specifies the time component (3 PM in the answer) while 'Where and when' also covers the notion of time. 'What date and where' is not appropriate since date is not mentioned or necessary in the context.,,,
1,551,hear,,,"The word 'hear' is the most appropriate choice in this context. In conversations regarding the announcement of a new policy, phrases like 'Did you hear about…' are commonly used. 'Know' would not be as natural in this context, and 'read' is typically used when referring to written content, not spoken announcements.",,,

'Sing' is the bare infinitive used after verbs like 'heard', while 'singing' emphasizes the ongoing action that was heard. 'Sang' is incorrect in this context because it doesn't correctly follow the structure of the sentence.",,,

1,568,surprised,,,,,,
1,569,to,,,,,,
1,570,because of,,,"The phrase 'because of' is the correct answer as it is used to indicate the cause or reason for something. In this sentence, 'because of a great teacher' means 'thanks to a great teacher', which corresponds to the meaning in Korean ('덕분에').
 
 Option 'because' is not grammatically correct without a following clause, and 'cause of' is an informal, abbreviated version that does not fit standard written English.",,,

1,576,run,exercise,,"Both 'run' and 'exercise' are acceptable answers because the Korean sentence '왜 매일 운동해요?' directly translates to 'Why do you exercise every day?' in which '운동하다' means to exercise. 'Run' fits in the context of physical activity and is a specific form of exercise, and 'exercise' is a more general term that matches the Korean verb directly. The option 'sleep' does not match the meaning at all since it does not contribute to health in the context provided.",,,

1,579,Go straight,,,"The Korean instruction '코너에서 우회전하기 전에 곧장 가세요' translates to 'Go straight and turn right at the corner.' 'Go straight' directly corresponds to '곧장 가세요', making it the appropriate choice. The other options do not match the intended meaning.",,,
1,580,take,,,"The word 'take' is correctly used to express the duration needed to complete the project. 'Make' does not fit in the phrase, and 'pass' is not appropriate in this context.",,,

1,582,cutting wood,,,,,,
1,583,recommend,suggest,,"Both 'recommend' and 'suggest' fit naturally in the sentence 'Can you ______ a good restaurant?' as they both mean to propose or advise something. 'Recommend' is commonly used in this context and directly translates to the Korean term for giving advice or a recommendation, while 'suggest' also correctly conveys the meaning of offering advice. 'Deny' does not fit the context, as it means to refuse or reject.",,,
1,584,like,,,,,,
1,585,help me carry,,,,,,
1,586,I think,I guess,,"Both 'I think' and 'I guess' naturally express the speaker's belief or expectation about the weather, matching the Korean sentence '내일 비가 올 것 같아,' which implies a degree of uncertainty or estimation. 'I assume' is less commonly used in this context because it tends to imply a presumption without evidence, making it less appropriate for a casual weather prediction.",,,

'Very captivating' does not naturally pair with the 'that' clause, and 'too captivating' implies a negative consequence or impossibility, which does not match the positive outcome described.",,,

1,599,watch,see,,"Both 'watch' and 'see' can be used naturally in this sentence:
 
 1. 'See' is appropriate because it refers to the ability to perceive something visually, which fits the Korean sentence indicating the ability to '볼 수 있어요.'
 2. 'Watch' also works as it implies actively observing the dancers, which is a natural interpretation of enjoying a performance.
 3. 'Hear' is not suitable because the sentence is about a visual experience.
 
 Thus, both 'watch' and 'see' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,600,Although,,,,,,
1,601,which,,,"The word 'which' correctly serves as a relative pronoun referring back to 'award,' linking the two clauses in the sentence. 'What' and 'who' do not fit, as 'what' is not typically used in this construction and 'who' refers to people, not objects or awards.",,,

1,606,Remember,Don't forget,,"Both 'Remember' and 'Don't forget' can be used as commands to advise someone to bring their homework. In English, 'Remember to bring your homework' and 'Don't forget to bring your homework' are commonly used phrases for reminding someone to do something. The option 'Do forget' is not natural in this context and does not convey the intended command correctly.",,,
1,607,heard,,,"The verb 'heard' appropriately matches the context of the sentence and the Korean translation, which implies 'to have listened or been informed about' the new movie. 'Watched' implies viewing and 'read' implies looking at written content, neither of which align with the Korean sentence meaning.",,,

1,619,recipes,,,"The word 'recipes' is the best choice because the sentence 'Trying new recipes is fun.' is grammatically correct and natural in English. 'Recipeing' is not a word, and using 'recipe' in the singular without an article (such as 'a' or 'the') makes the sentence sound incomplete.",,,
1,620,find,,,,,,
1,621,is,,,"The museum is singular, so the singular verb 'is' must be used in the passive voice construction 'is preserved by the community'. The other options are not grammatically correct in this context.",,,
1,622,who,,,,,,
1,623,discovered,have discovered,,"Both 'discovered' and 'have discovered' are acceptable in this sentence.
 
 1. 'Discovered' aligns well with the simple past tense version of the Korean sentence, which uses the past marker '-었어요'.
 2. 'Have discovered' is also a plausible choice because it implies that the discovery is relevant to the present, which can match the sentiment of realizing new paths in life.
 3. 'Will discover' is not appropriate as the Korean sentence is expressed in the past tense.
 
 Thus, both 'discovered' and 'have discovered' are possible answers.",,,
1,624,exciting,,,"The word 'exciting' is the correct choice because the sentence requires an adjective to describe the experience of exploring new trails. 'Exciting' fits grammatically and conveys the meaning that the activity is stimulating and fun. 'Excite' is a verb and does not fit the sentence structure, and 'excitingly' is an adverb, not an adjective, so it is also incorrect.",,,
1,625,appreciate,,,"The correct answer is 'appreciate' because the structure 'make you appreciate' requires the base form of the verb after 'make you', and it properly conveys that the exhibition influences your perception of art. 'Appreciated' and 'appreciating' do not grammatically fit in this context.",,,
1,626,too unpredictable,so unpredictable,,"Both 'too unpredictable' and 'so unpredictable' are grammatically correct choices in this sentence. 
 1. 'Too unpredictable' implies an excessive level of unpredictability that prevented planning the trip. 
 2. 'So unpredictable' expresses a high degree of unpredictability, which naturally leads into the result clause 'that we couldn't plan our trip.' 
 The option 'so unpredictably' is incorrect because it uses an adverb form where an adjective is required.",,,
1,627,makes,,,,,,
1,628,want,,,,,,
1,629,to solve,,,,,,
1,630,heard,,,,,,
1,631,that reveals true emotions,,,"The sentence requires the relative clause to agree with the singular noun 'a place'. Therefore, 'that reveals true emotions' is grammatically correct. The option using 'reveal' is incorrect because it does not match the singular subject, and 'who reveals' is inappropriate because 'who' is used for people, not places.",,,
1,632,warm,,,"The correct answer is 'warm' because the simile structure 'as ___ as' requires a base adjective without a comparative form. 'Warmer' is a comparative adjective, and 'warmest' is a superlative adjective. Therefore, 'warm' fits the sentence grammatically and contextually.",,,
1,633,where the painting is displayed,,,"Option 2 is the correct answer because when forming an embedded question, the sentence structure should not use subject-verb inversion. The phrase 'where the painting is displayed' follows the proper embedded question format. Option 1 incorrectly uses inversion ('where is the painting displayed') as if it were a direct question, and Option 3 lacks the appropriate article before 'painting'.",,,

1,637,cake,,,,,,
1,638,sustainable living,,,,,,
1,639,wrong,,,"The correct phrasing is 'What's wrong with your leg?', which is a common way to ask if there is a problem or issue with someone's leg. 'Worry' doesn't grammatically or semantically fit in this sentence, and 'right' would imply something positive instead of addressing a problem.",,,
1,640,Can you make it,,,,,,
1,641,use,,,,,,
1,642,not supposed to,,,,,,
1,643,I hope you'll do well,,,"Option 2 'I hope you'll do well' directly corresponds to the Korean sentence '네가 잘 하길 바래', which implies wishing someone to perform well generally. Option 1 'I hope you'll pass' focuses on passing the test specifically, and Option 3 'I hope you study hard' is more about the preparation rather than the result. Only Option 2 fits naturally with the intended meaning.",,,
1,644,look like,,,,,,
1,645,I’m not happy with,,,,,,
1,646,Don't forget to,Remember to,,"Both 'Don't forget to' and 'Remember to' naturally fit into the imperative sentence structure and carry the intended meaning of reminding someone to return the books. 'Don't forget to' is the most direct translation of the Korean reminder, while 'Remember to' also effectively conveys the instruction. 'Make sure you' is less ideal because it doesn't align as directly with the omission in the original sentence.",,,
1,647,eaten,tried,,"Both 'eaten' and 'tried' can naturally fill the blank in the sentence. 'Eaten' directly refers to the act of consuming sushi, while 'tried' implies having the experience of tasting new food, which is a common way to ask if someone has sampled sushi. 'Watched' is not appropriate in this context, as sushi is eaten rather than observed.",,,
1,648,bake,,,,,,
1,649,biodiversity,,,"The correct answer is 'biodiversity' because the Korean sentence is asking about '생물 다양성', which translates to 'biodiversity'. The other options 'evolution' and 'habitat' do not match the meaning of the Korean sentence.",,,
1,650,surprising,,,,,,
1,651,who,,,,,,
1,652,who I value the most,whom I value the most,,"Both 'who I value the most' and 'whom I value the most' can be accepted in this sentence. 'Whom' is traditionally correct as it is the object of the verb 'value', while 'who' is commonly used in everyday speech and is widely accepted. The option 'which I value the most' is unsuitable because 'which' is generally used for non-human objects.",,,
1,653,important,,,,,,
1,654,was watered,,,,,,
1,655,asked,,,,,,
1,656,let,,,"The verb 'let' is appropriate because it means to allow someone to do something. In this context, 'I will let my friend have a small gift' correctly conveys that the speaker is permitting their friend to receive a gift. The other options do not fit well: 'make' implies force rather than permission, and 'have' would incorrectly suggest that the speaker is giving the gift themselves.",,,
1,657,have enjoyed,,,"The subject 'I' requires the base form of the auxiliary 'have' in the present perfect, making 'have enjoyed' the correct choice. 'Had enjoyed' uses the past perfect which is unnecessary in this context, and 'has enjoyed' is incorrect due to subject-verb disagreement.",,,
1,658,most,,,,,,
1,659,finish,,,,,,
1,660,where,,,The correct choice is 'where' because the Korean sentence indicates the destination (어디로 여행갈지) which corresponds to 'where'. 'How' and 'when' do not match the context of choosing a destination.,,,
1,661,to enjoy,,,,,,
1,662,vast,,,"The adjective 'vast' best reflects the meaning of the Korean word '광활해요', which conveys a sense of immeasurable, expansive space. Although 'wide' could technically be used in a literal spatial sense, 'vast' is much more commonly associated with the grand, overwhelming scale implied in the sentence describing both the forest and one's dreams. 'Big' does not convey the appropriate nuance for describing expansiveness.",,,
1,663,Before,,,,,,
1,664,too,,,,,,
1,665,smiling,,,,,,
1,666,when the bus arrives,what time the bus arrives,,"Both 'when the bus arrives' and 'what time the bus arrives' are acceptable in the sentence. 'When the bus arrives' uses correct embedded question structure without inversion, which is common in reported questions. 'What time the bus arrives' conveys the same meaning by specifying the inquiry about the arrival time. On the other hand, 'when does the bus arrive' is not appropriate here because embedded questions do not require subject-auxiliary inversion.",,,
1,667,think,,,"The quiz asks for someone's opinion and the Korean translation clearly uses the concept of '생각해', which corresponds to 'think'. While 'feel' and 'say' can be used in different contexts, 'think' is the most natural and grammatically correct option for expressing an opinion in this sentence.",,,
1,668,I can't wait for,,,"The sentence '나는 여름 방학이 너무 기대돼' translates to an expression of excitement for summer vacation. 'I can't wait for' expresses anticipation and eagerness, which fits the intended meaning. The other options do not convey the same enthusiastic anticipation.",,,
1,669,planning,going,,"Both 'planning' and 'going' can be used naturally in the sentence 'I'm ______ to travel to Europe next year'.
 
 1. 'I'm planning to travel to Europe next year' effectively conveys the intention and arrangement related to a future trip, which aligns well with '내년에 유럽으로 여행 갈 계획이야.'
 2. 'I'm going to travel to Europe next year' is also a common and grammatically correct way to express a future plan, using the 'going to' future construction.
 3. 'Thinking' doesn't fit grammatically as 'I'm thinking to travel' is not a standard expression in English for future plans.
 
 Thus, both 'planning' and 'going' could be considered correct answers.",,,
1,670,make it at,get there by,,"Both 'make it at' and 'get there by' appropriately convey the meaning of being able to arrive or be present by the specified time of 3 p.m. 
 
 1. 'Make it at' is a common idiomatic expression used to ask if someone can attend or be there for an arranged time.
 2. 'Get there by' also fits naturally as it asks if someone can arrive by a certain time.
 
 While 'arrive at' is grammatically correct, it is less idiomatic in this context where the conversational tone typically uses expressions like 'make it' or 'get there by'.",,,
1,671,K-pop,,,,,,
1,672,stay up,,,"The phrase 'stay up' fits the natural expression 'stay up too late,' meaning to not remain awake past a late hour. 'Wake up' does not work because it implies getting out of sleep, and 'sleep early' contradicts the original sentence structure advising not to do that too late.",,,
1,673,Do you remember,Can you recall,,"Both 'Do you remember' and 'Can you recall' fit naturally in the context of asking if someone remembers an event. The Korean sentence '우리 제주도 여행 기억나?' directly translates to asking if you remember the trip, making both options appropriate. 'Have you ever thought about' does not convey the same meaning as it suggests a consideration process rather than recalling a memory.",,,
1,674,see,,,,,,
1,675,play the piano,,,,,,
1,676,First,,,,,,
1,677,What,,,,,,
1,678,surprising,amazing,,"Both 'surprising' and 'amazing' can be used to express astonishment, which aligns with the Korean expression '정말 놀랍다!'.
 
 1. 'Surprising' directly translates to 놀라움을 주는, matching the literal meaning.
 2. 'Amazing' conveys a strong sense of wonder and astonishment, which is also a natural response to something very surprising.
 3. 'Exciting' does not fit because it implies stimulation or enthusiasm rather than surprise.
 
 Thus, 'surprising' and 'amazing' are the possible correct answers.",,,
1,679,interested,,,,,,
1,680,Good job,,,,,,
1,681,I’m angry at,I’m not happy about,,"Both 'I’m angry at' and 'I’m not happy about' correctly express dissatisfaction, matching the Korean sentence which conveys a complaint about the service. 'I’m angry at' indicates emotional displeasure, while 'I’m not happy about' conveys a less intense, but clear negative sentiment. Option 3, 'I’m pleased with', contradicts the complaint expressed.",,,
1,682,I’m thinking of,,,"The correct choice is 'I’m thinking of' because the sentence requires a construction that pairs with the gerund 'changing'. 'Thinking of' naturally combines with the '-ing' form as in 'thinking of changing', which matches the given sentence '내가 내 일을 바꾸려고 생각 중이야'. The other options, 'I’m planning to' and 'I intend to', require the base form of the verb (e.g., 'change') and would result in ungrammatical phrases if combined with 'changing'.",,,
1,683,to read,,,,,,
1,684,if,,,"The sentence expresses a condition: if they attend the local concert, then they will enjoy music. This matches the Korean sentence where '참석하면' indicates a conditional clause. 'Because' would denote a reason and 'when' focuses on the timing, making 'if' the best fit.",,,

1,688,a few,,,,,,
1,689,running,,,"The sentence describes an ongoing action and the use of the present participle 'running' fits grammatically in the sentence. 'Runned' is incorrect, and 'ran' implies a completed action, which does not match the continuous scene depicted. Therefore, 'running' is the correct choice.",,,

1,700,study,,,,,,
1,701,bring,do,,"The phrase 'Don't forget to ___ your homework' can be completed in two acceptable ways depending on the context. 'Bring' fits the Korean translation '숙제를 가져오는 것을 잊지 마세요' (which literally means 'Don't forget to bring your homework'), while 'do' is a common English collocation in the context of homework. 'Take' is less appropriate in this context, so 'bring' and 'do' are both possible answers.",,,
1,702,Don't,You'd better not,,"Both 'Don't be late.' and 'You'd better not be late.' are natural imperatives to warn someone against being late. 'Don't be late.' is a straightforward command, while 'You'd better not be late.' conveys a strong advisory tone to prevent lateness. 'You must not be late.' is less common in casual warnings and sounds overly strict, which is why it is not chosen.",,,
1,703,swim,,,,,,
1,704,reading,,,,,,
1,705,join,,,"The correct answer is 'join' because the Korean sentence asks if you are going to become a member of the club (동아리에 가입할 거니?), and 'join' directly translates to becoming a member. 'Visit' suggests a temporary or short-term stay and 'attend' could imply participation in events, neither of which precisely capture the meaning of becoming a member.",,,
1,706,I hope,,,"The phrase 'I hope you have a great day' is a common and natural expression that aligns with the intended meaning of the Korean sentence '좋은 하루 보내길 바란다.' Although 'I wish' might superficially seem possible, it is less common and often requires a different construction (e.g., 'I wish you a great day'), and 'I'd like' does not fit grammatically in this context.",,,
1,707,Go,,,,,,
1,708,prefer,,,,,,
1,709,why,,,,,,
1,710,I heard,,,"The sentence corresponds to the meaning in Korean ('나는 그녀가 뉴욕으로 이사 갔다는 말을 들었어'), which indicates that the speaker heard about her move. 'I heard' directly conveys this, whereas 'I believe' or 'I know' would suggest different nuances of certainty or belief rather than simply receiving information.",,,
1,711,enough,,,"The sentence 'It’s important that you get ___ sleep.' requires an adjective that can directly modify the uncountable noun 'sleep' without additional words. 'Enough' fits perfectly here, indicating a sufficient amount of sleep. 'Plenty' would normally require the preposition 'of' (as in 'plenty of sleep'), and 'good' does not convey the idea of sufficiency in quantity.",,,
1,712,critical thinking,,,"The Korean sentence asks for the meaning of '비판적 사고', which directly translates to 'critical thinking'. While 'creative thinking' and 'analytical thinking' are related cognitive processes, 'critical thinking' is the correct match for the given Korean description.",,,
1,713,surprised,,,,,,
1,714,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' are fitting in the sentence 'Can you _____ me, please?' and accurately translate the Korean 제발 나를 도와줄 수 있나요? Here’s why:
 
 1. 'help' is the most common and natural choice in everyday language for asking for assistance.
 2. 'assist' is also grammatically correct and formal, making it a valid alternative.
 3. 'support' usually implies ongoing or additional backing rather than immediate direct help, and therefore doesn’t fit as naturally in this context.",,,
1,715,to deliver,,,,,,
1,716,use,,,,,,
1,717,make,,,,,,
1,718,who,,,,,,
1,719,is respected,,,"The sentence is in the present tense as indicated by the Korean sentence '존경받고 있어요', which means 'is respected'. The option 'is respected' correctly uses the passive voice to indicate that the historic monument is currently in the state of being respected by many visitors. 'Respects' is incorrect because it implies an active verb and does not fit the subject, and 'was respected' implies a past state which does not match the present continuous tense of the Korean sentence.",,,

1,728,Not only,,,,,,
1,729,who,whom,,"Both 'who' and 'whom' can be considered correct in this sentence. 'Whom' is grammatically precise as it serves as the object of the verb 'admire' in the relative clause 'readers admire.' However, 'who' is commonly used in everyday language even when referring to an object, making it an acceptable alternative in less formal contexts. The option 'which' is not appropriate because it is used for non-human antecedents.",,,
1,730,may,,,,,,
1,731,hope,,,"The sentence 'I hope I can pass the test' is the most natural and grammatically correct expression to convey the desire and expectation of passing the test as stated in the Korean sentence. 'Wish' is typically used for unreal or hypothetical situations and would require a different modal form (e.g., 'I wish I could pass the test'), while 'need' does not express hope or desire.",,,
1,732,planning,,,,,,
1,733,eat,,,,,,
1,734,lock,,,,,,
1,735,cook spaghetti,,,,,,
1,736,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' are natural choices in the sentence 'What do you ___ doing when you have free time?'.
 
 1. 'What do you like doing?' is a common phrasing to ask about someone's hobby or preference.
 2. 'What do you enjoy doing?' is also frequently used to inquire about activities one finds pleasurable.
 3. 'Prefer' is less fitting in this structure; it is more natural to say 'prefer to do' instead of 'prefer doing', making it the less appropriate option in this sentence.
 
 Thus, 'like' and 'enjoy' are the possible correct answers.",,,
1,737,worried,,,,,,
1,738,think,,,,,,
1,739,prefer,like,,"Both 'prefer' and 'like' can logically complete the sentence when asking someone to choose between two drinks.
 
 1. 'Like' directly corresponds to the Korean verb 좋아하다 and fits naturally when asking which drink the person likes, especially since the response is 'I like coffee.'
 2. 'Prefer' is also acceptable, as it asks for a choice between options, implying a comparative preference between coffee and tea.
 3. 'Enjoy' is less common in this context because it typically implies deriving pleasure from something rather than expressing a simple liking or preference.
 
 Thus, both 'prefer' and 'like' are possible answers.",,,
1,740,can't wait,,,,,,
1,741,been to Japan,,,,,,
1,742,like,,,,,,
1,743,That,It,,"Both ‘That’ and ‘It’ can be acceptable in this sentence.
 
 1. 'That sounds like fun' is a common, idiomatic expression used to refer to an activity or idea that seems enjoyable.
 2. 'It sounds like fun' is also acceptable as a dummy subject referring to a previously mentioned idea or plan.
 3. 'This' is less natural in this context because it suggests something closer or immediately present, which is not as typical for the given sentence.
 
 Thus, 'That' and 'It' are both plausible choices.",,,
1,744,Is it possible,Can you,,"Both 'Is it possible' and 'Can you' work naturally in the given sentence. 'Is it possible to change the schedule?' directly translates the Korean meaning of asking whether it is feasible to alter the schedule, while 'Can you change the schedule?' also implies asking about the possibility or ability to change the schedule. 'Are you able' is less natural in this context.",,,

1,753,don't you,,,"The tag question is used to ask for agreement or confirmation. 'Don't you' is appropriate because the main clause is in the present simple ('enjoy'), and in tag questions, a positive statement is typically followed by a negative tag. 'Aren't you' grammatically doesn't match with 'you enjoy', and 'didn't you' implies a past action which isn't fitting here.",,,
1,754,cozy,,,,,,
1,755,see,,,"The word 'see' is the best fit because it accurately reflects the act of observing robots as described by the Korean sentence, which means 'to see'. The option 'look' would typically require 'at' to form 'look at', and 'listen' would imply hearing rather than visual observation.",,,
1,756,asked,,,,,,
1,757,when,,,,,,
1,758,to improve my skill,to improve my skills,,"Both 'to improve my skill' and 'to improve my skills' are grammatically acceptable answers that can complete the sentence appropriately. 
 
 1. Although 'skill' is singular in option 1, it can be used to represent overall ability. 
 
 2. 'Skills' in option 2 is also common as it implies multiple aspects of language ability. 
 
 3. Option 3 is incorrect because 'for improve my skills' is grammatically ungrammatical.",,,

1,767,good,great,,"Both 'good' and 'great' are acceptable in this context. 'Good at' is the more common idiom to indicate proficiency, matching the Korean sentence '나는 퍼즐 푸는 것을 잘해'. 'Great at' is also used informally to express a high level of ability, making it a possible answer as well. 'Strong' is typically used for physical strength rather than skill, so it does not fit as naturally.",,,
1,768,sure,,,,,,
1,769,What,Which,,"Both 'What' and 'Which' can be acceptable answers in this context. 'What kind of pet do you want to have?' is a common way to ask an open-ended question about preferences, while 'Which kind of pet do you want to have?' is also used when the speaker implies the choice is among a limited, known set of pets. 'How' does not fit because it refers to manner or method rather than type.",,,
1,770,find,,,,,,
1,771,Have,,,,,,
1,772,How,,,,,,
1,773,Can,Will,,"Both 'Can' and 'Will' are commonly used when asking for help. 'Can you help me carry this box?' emphasizes the ability to help, while 'Will you help me carry this box?' focuses on the willingness to help. The context of asking for assistance in carrying a box makes either option grammatically and semantically acceptable. 'Do' is not suitable because it doesn't convey asking about ability or willingness.",,,
1,774,for,,,,,,
1,775,Why,,,"The option 'Why' fits naturally in the suggestion structure 'Why don't we go to the amusement park?', which is a common way to propose an activity. 'What' and 'How' do not form grammatically appropriate suggestions in this context.",,,
1,776,shall,will,,"Both 'shall' and 'will' can be used in questions about future plans. 'Shall' is often used when making a suggestion or proposal (e.g., 'What time shall we go to the park?'), while 'will' is a common form for future predictions (e.g., 'What time will we go to the park?'). The use of either can be acceptable depending on the nuance intended. However, 'can' does not fit well in this context because it implies ability rather than a future plan.",,,
1,777,prefer,like,,"Both 'prefer' and 'like' work naturally in the sentence. 'Prefer' emphasizes a choice between options, which is in line with asking which one is favored, while 'like' is also commonly used in casual conversation to express preference. 'Want' does not fit appropriately as it implies a desire rather than a comparative preference.",,,
1,778,recommend,suggest,,"Both 'recommend' and 'suggest' fit naturally in the sentence 'Could you ___ a movie for me?'.
 1. 'Recommend' is commonly used when asking someone to propose a movie that they think would be good, matching the Korean sentence which asks for a movie recommendation.
 2. 'Suggest' is also appropriate as it similarly means to put forward an idea or proposal, making it a valid choice.
 3. 'Tell' would not be correct in this context as it generally implies informing rather than proposing, making 'recommend' and 'suggest' the only suitable options.",,,
1,779,I’ve,I,,"Both 'I’ve' (short for 'I have heard') and 'I' (as in 'I heard') work well in the sentence. 'I’ve heard our school is getting a new gym.' uses the present perfect to indicate a recent discovery, while 'I heard our school is getting a new gym.' uses the simple past, which is also natural in conversational English. 'I’d' (short for 'I had heard') is less common in this context, making the other two options the better choices.",,,
1,780,forget,,,,,,
1,781,interested,keen,,"Both 'interested' and 'keen' can appropriately fill the blank in the sentence. 'Interested' is the most common choice in American English ('I’m interested in learning new languages.'), while 'keen' is also acceptable, particularly in British English ('I’m keen on learning new languages.'). The option 'active' does not convey the same meaning of having an interest or inclination towards learning languages.",,,
1,782,How,,,"The sentence '___ often do you go to the gym?' is a typical frequency-related question that requires the use of the word 'How', forming the phrase 'How often' which is correct in this context. 'What' and 'When' do not correctly pair with 'often' to form a grammatically correct question regarding frequency.",,,
1,783,who,that,,"Both 'who' and 'that' are acceptable relative pronouns when referring to people. In this sentence, the musician is a person, so 'who' is the most appropriate choice due to its explicit reference to people, while 'that' is also commonly used in defining relative clauses referring to people. 'Which' is typically reserved for animals or inanimate objects, making it the less appropriate choice in this context.",,,
1,784,While,When,,"Both 'While' and 'When' can indicate that two actions are happening at the same time. In the context of the sentence, 'While he was jogging, he listened to music' clearly shows simultaneous actions, which matches the Korean '그는 조깅하는 동안' meaning 'while he was jogging'. Likewise, 'When he was jogging, he listened to music' is also acceptable in casual usage to indicate the same temporal overlap. 'After' does not match the meaning of '동안', as it would indicate a sequential action rather than simultaneous actions.",,,
1,785,has,,,"The correct answer is 'has' because the present perfect tense is used with the third person singular subject 'she'. Using 'have' would be incorrect for third person singular, and 'had' would change the tense to past perfect, which does not match the context of the sentence.",,,
1,786,apartment,,,,,,
1,787,to,,,,,,
1,788,fun,,,,,,
1,789,whom,,,"The correct answer is 'whom' because it functions as the object in the relative clause 'she admires.' Although 'who' is sometimes used in informal contexts, the formal and grammatically proper choice here is 'whom.' 'Which' is inappropriate since it is used for non-human subjects.",,,
1,790,that,,,"The sentence uses the structure 'so...that' to express result ('She was so tired that she fell asleep instantly'). 'Than' is used for comparisons and 'because' for cause, making them unsuitable in this sentence.",,,
1,791,practices,,,"In conditional sentences of the form 'If + present simple, ... will...', the present simple tense is used for the condition. The correct verb form for the third person singular 'she' is 'practices'. 'Practice' is the base form and 'practicing' is a gerund, so neither fits grammatically in this conditional sentence.",,,

1,793,was,,,,,,
1,794,someone,,,,,,
1,795,clearly,,,,,,
1,796,apologize,,,,,,
1,797,climbing,,,"The correct answer is 'climbing' because when using perception verbs like 'saw', the present participle form is used to describe an ongoing action. 'Climbing' fits the structure 'saw the cat climbing the tree', which correctly translates the Korean sentence.",,,
1,798,to join,,,,,,
1,799,What would you like to do?,,,"The Korean sentence asks '무엇을 하고 싶니?' which translates to 'What would you like to do?', making 'What would you like to do?' the most appropriate option. The other options focus on destination and method of travel, which do not directly address the question.",,,

1,804,lock,,,,,,
1,805,What’s wrong?,What’s the matter?,,"Both 'What’s wrong?' and 'What’s the matter?' appropriately ask about someone’s condition or if something is amiss, which directly corresponds to the Korean phrase asking about someone's well-being when they have a headache. 'How are you?' does not convey the same urgency regarding a potential problem.",,,
1,806,I have no doubt that,,,"The Korean sentence expresses absolute certainty about her success. 'I have no doubt that' perfectly captures this meaning. In contrast, 'I assume that' suggests an estimate or presumption rather than certainty, and 'I believe that' does not emphasize the absence of doubt as strongly as required by the Korean statement.",,,
1,807,In my opinion,,,,,,
1,808,meet,see,,"Both 'meet' and 'see' can naturally complete the sentence in the context of reuniting with family.
 
 1. 'Meet' is acceptable as it can imply the act of encountering family members again during a reunion.
 2. 'See' is the most common and idiomatic choice for reuniting with family, as it emphasizes the act of spending time together and catching up.
 3. 'Visit' sounds less natural in this context, as it implies going to someone's place rather than the reunion aspect.
 
 Thus, 'meet' and 'see' are both possible answers.",,,
1,809,prefer,,,,,,
1,810,bring,,,,,,
1,811,use,,,,,,
1,812,likely,,,"The word 'likely' best fits the sentence 'It is ___ that it will rain tomorrow' because it expresses that there is a high probability of rain, which corresponds with the Korean sentence indicating the possibility of rain. 'Impossible' and 'certain' do not convey the appropriate level of likelihood.",,,
1,813,have been exploring,,,"The Korean sentence '저는 이번 여름에 지역 시장들을 탐험해왔어요' implies that the exploration of local markets has been an ongoing activity that started in the past and may still be relevant now. 'Have been exploring' perfectly captures this continuous action up until the present, which is why it is the most suitable option. In contrast, 'am exploring' suggests an action currently in progress without the implication of duration, and 'have explored' implies a completed action without emphasizing the ongoing nature of the exploration.",,,
1,814,which,,,,,,
1,815,packed,,,,,,
1,816,if,whether,,Both 'if' and 'whether' are acceptable in this sentence for forming an indirect yes/no question. 'Wheather' is a misspelling and therefore not considered a valid option.,,,
1,817,to conserve energy,,,,,,
1,818,save,,,,,,
1,819,had,,,"The sentence refers to a hypothetical scenario in the past, as indicated by the Korean translation. 'Had' is the correct choice because it forms the past unreal conditional, matching the context 'if you had a smart assistant.' 'Has' is present tense and 'have' doesn’t fit the conditional mood.",,,
1,820,what,,,,,,
1,821,including,,,,,,
1,822,Since,Because,,"Both 'Since' and 'Because' can be used to indicate a cause-effect relationship. In the sentence, they explain that the speaker did not know how to react due to it being their first experience with heavy rain. 'Although' would imply a contrast rather than a reason, so it is not appropriate in this context.",,,
1,823,can be recognized,,,,,,
1,824,where,,,"The sentence describes the lab as a place in which innovative ideas are born. 'Where' is the appropriate relative adverb to indicate location. 'When' would indicate time and 'what' does not fit grammatically, making 'where' the correct choice.",,,
1,825,Hearing,,,,,,
1,826,so that,,,,,,
1,827,In my view,In my opinion,,"Both 'In my view' and 'In my opinion' accurately and naturally translate the Korean phrase '내 생각에는', making them suitable completions of the sentence. 'I think that' is less appropriate in this context because it typically introduces a clause, whereas the sentence structure here calls for a brief phrase.",,,
1,828,service,,,,,,
1,829,What do you think of,How do you like,,"Both 'What do you think of' and 'How do you like' are common ways to ask someone's opinion about a new job. They naturally invite a subjective evaluation, as seen in the response 'I like it a lot.' On the other hand, 'Do you enjoy' is typically used for asking about enjoyment in a yes/no format and feels less fitting in this conversational context.",,,
1,830,good,great,,"Both 'good' and 'great' are commonly used expressions to praise someone's work, and they fit naturally in the sentence 'You did a ___ job!' 'Good job' is a standard compliment, and 'great job' emphasizes a higher level of achievement. 'Fine job' is less commonly used in this context and does not convey the same level of commendation.",,,

1,836,It isn’t clear to me,,,,,,
1,837,Can I give you a hand?,,,"Option 2, 'Can I give you a hand?', is the natural and common way to offer assistance in this context. It fits the dialogue well, as Person A is offering help and Person B's response of 'Yes, please. That would be great.' confirms the offer. The other options are either too formal or awkward in phrasing for an everyday conversation.",,,
1,838,solve this problem,,,,,,
1,839,Let me check.,Let me see.,,"Both 'Let me check.' and 'Let me see.' are colloquial expressions used when you want to pause to think before confirming an appointment, making them natural choices in this context where someone is asked about 3 PM. 'Let me check.' implies confirming availability, and 'Let me see.' similarly indicates a moment of thought, which fits the conversational tone shown in the quiz. 'Let me consider.' is less common and formal in this casual context.",,,
1,840,bring,,,,,,
1,841,to,,,,,,
1,842,in Asia,,,"The sentence indicates that the creation of spicy noodles occurred in Asia, as supported by the Korean translation stating that it was made in Asia ('아시아에서'). 'In Africa' and 'in Europe' do not match the location described in the Korean sentence. Therefore, 'in Asia' is the only correct answer.",,,
1,843,what,,,"In this sentence, 'what' is used to refer to the thing or things that the mentor recommends. 'Which' is typically used for selecting a specific option from a known set and 'who' is used for referring to a person. Thus, 'what' is the only correct choice.",,,
1,844,had forgotten,,,"The sentence requires the past perfect tense to indicate that the forgetting occurred before the meeting. 'Had forgotten' correctly reflects this sequence of events, whereas 'had forget' is grammatically incorrect and 'forgot' does not indicate the proper prior action relative to the meeting.",,,
1,845,where,,,,,,
1,846,stated,,,"The word 'stated' properly fits the context as it is in the past tense, matching the Korean sentence which indicates that Alex already expressed this in the past. 'Say' is in the base form and does not convey the past tense needed here, and 'says' is in the present tense, which would be grammatically incorrect in this context. Therefore, 'stated' is the correct choice.",,,
1,847,were,,,"The sentence is a counterfactual conditional statement (hypothetical situation) where the correct subjunctive form of the verb 'to be' is 'were'. Using 'were' indicates that the speaker considers the situation to be unreal or hypothetical. 'Are' and 'was' do not express the same hypothetical nuance, making 'were' the appropriate choice.",,,
1,848,who,,,,,,
1,849,named,,,,,,
1,850,made,,,,,,
1,851,Working,,,,,,
1,852,quicker,,,"The sentence uses a comparative structure ('the less ... the ___') which requires a comparative adjective to indicate an increase in the recovery speed as the resting time decreases. 'Quicker' is the comparative form of 'quick', making it the appropriate choice over 'quick' (base form) or 'quickest' (superlative form).",,,
1,853,whisper,whispering,,"Both 'whisper' and 'whispering' are grammatically acceptable in this context. The construction 'hear the wind + bare infinitive' (whisper) is commonly used to indicate that one perceives the action occurring. Similarly, 'hear the wind + present participle' (whispering) also conveys that the wind is in the process of producing a whisper-like sound. 'Whispered' (past tense) does not fit naturally here as it incorrectly suggests a completed action instead of an ongoing or typical behavior.",,,
1,854,vibrant,,,,,,
1,855,ever,,,"The word 'ever' is the correct choice because it is commonly used in questions to inquire about experiences at any time in the past, which matches the intent of asking if someone has been to Japan before. The other options, 'always' and 'already', do not fit the context of asking about past experience.",,,
1,856,achieve,,,,,,
1,857,order,,,,,,
1,858,to go,,,"The phrase 'for here or to go' is the common expression used when ordering food. While 'dine in' also implies eating in the establishment, it's not typically used in this conversational context. 'For here' is already mentioned in the question, so the correct complementary option is 'to go'.",,,
1,859,sustainable,,,,,,
1,860,say,,,,,,
1,861,exchange,,,"The sentence in English closely matches the meaning of the Korean sentence, which refers specifically to exchanging an item (교환). The word 'exchange' denotes swapping the shirt for a larger size, making it the most appropriate choice.",,,
1,862,refund,,,,,,
1,863,exercise,,,,,,
1,864,recommend,suggest,,"Both 'recommend' and 'suggest' are acceptable in this sentence given the Korean translation, which means 'to advise or propose' trying the restaurant. 'Recommend' is commonly used in English to advise someone to try something, and 'suggest' has a similar meaning in this context. 'Insist' does not fit because it conveys a stronger demand rather than a friendly proposal.",,,
1,865,passing,,,,,,
1,866,excited,,,,,,
1,867,bake,,,"The verb 'bake' directly refers to the process of cooking with dry heat, especially in an oven, which is the correct method for making a cake. 'Mix' and 'fry' do not match the verb meaning in this context as ‘mix’ means to combine ingredients and ‘fry’ means to cook in oil.",,,
1,868,appreciate,,,,,,
1,869,season,,,"The word 'season' is the appropriate choice because it directly translates to '계절' in Korean, which matches the context of the question where two seasons (summer and winter) are mentioned. 'Time' and 'weather' do not correctly convey the meaning of '계절'.",,,
1,870,I believe that,It seems to me that,"In my opinion,","Each of the three options conveys a personal opinion that aligns well with the Korean expression '내 생각에는'. 'I believe that' and 'It seems to me that' are complete expressions that lead into a statement of opinion, while 'In my opinion,' is a direct translation and natural introductory phrase. All three options appropriately fit the sentence structure, making them valid choices.",,,
1,871,if,whether,,"Both 'if' and 'whether' can introduce indirect yes/no questions and fit naturally in the sentence. In this case, 'I didn't know if I truly enjoyed the new club' and 'I didn't know whether I truly enjoyed the new club' are both grammatically correct and convey the intended meaning.
 
 The option 'ever' does not logically fit the sentence.",,,
1,872,makes,,,,,,
1,873,which means,,,"In this sentence, 'which means' is the most appropriate option because it acts as a relative clause that adds explanatory information about the Latin word 'novella'. 'That means' is less common and more informal in this context, and 'who means' is grammatically incorrect since it is used to refer to people rather than objects or words.",,,
1,874,been,,,,,,
1,875,holding,,,"The word 'holding' correctly describes the supporters that are in the process of carrying the banners, which fits naturally as a descriptive clause in the sentence. 'Holds' is incorrect due to subject-verb disagreement (supporters is plural) and 'held' does not convey the ongoing action.",,,
1,876,written,,,"The correct answer is 'written' because the sentence requires the past participle form to correctly form the past perfect tense ('I had written many stories before I turned ten'). 'Wrote' is the simple past form, and 'write' is the base form, both of which do not fit grammatically in this construction.",,,
1,877,Using,,,,,,
1,878,to,,,,,,
1,879,to meet,,,,,,
1,880,so that,,,,,,
1,881,feels amazing,,,"The correct answer is 'feels amazing' because the sentence uses 'it' as a dummy subject that requires a singular verb ('feels'). Additionally, the adjective 'amazing' is required to describe the state, whereas 'amazingly' is an adverb and does not grammatically fit in the sentence.",,,
1,882,what,,,,,,
1,883,as,,,,,,
1,884,that,which,,"Both 'that' and 'which' can be correctly used in relative clauses. In this sentence, they serve to introduce a defining relative clause that provides essential information about 'the book' (i.e., the book every writer cherishes). 'That' is commonly used in restrictive clauses, while 'which' is equally acceptable in formal usage, making both options suitable. 'What' is not appropriate here, as it does not function as a relative pronoun in such constructions.",,,
1,885,As,,,,,,
1,886,could,,,,,,
1,887,How have you been doing?,How have you been?,,"Both 'How have you been doing?' and 'How have you been?' naturally inquire about someone's recent well-being and match the response 'I’ve been great, thanks for asking.' They are grammatically correct and commonly used in casual conversation. 'How was everything going?' is less suitable because it shifts the focus and doesn't directly ask about the person's state.",,,
1,888,glad,happy,pleased,"All three options are acceptable in the context of the sentence. The sentence 'I'm ___ to hear that' is commonly filled with adjectives that express a positive reaction to hearing good news. 'Glad', 'happy', and 'pleased' all convey this sentiment: they mean feeling good about something and align with the Korean sentence conveying joy upon hearing news. Although 'glad' is the most commonly used in everyday conversation, both 'happy' and 'pleased' are also grammatically and contextually correct, making all three answers possible.",,,

1,896,pass,,,,,,
1,897,helping,,,"The most natural and commonly used expression in this context is 'helping.' While 'aiding' and 'assisting' are grammatically correct, they tend to be more formal and are less typical in everyday language when thanking someone for their support with homework.",,,
1,898,not allowed,,,,,,
1,899,wonder,,,,,,
1,900,drinking water is good for your skin,,,,,,
1,901,checked,,,,,,
1,902,you succeed,you do well,,"Both 'you succeed' and 'you do well' naturally complete the sentence in a way that reflects the Korean meaning '네가 잘하길 바래!', which expresses the hope that someone will perform well or achieve success. 'You succeed' directly implies achieving success, while 'you do well' broadly implies performing well. On the other hand, 'you will win' is more specific to winning a contest or competition, which does not entirely capture the general sentiment of the Korean phrase.",,,
1,903,for us to decide on a new plan,,,,,,
1,904,are,,,"The subject 'one third of our school books' refers to a fraction of a countable plural noun ('books'), which typically takes a plural verb. Thus, 'are' is the grammatically correct option in this context.",,,
1,905,let,had,got,"All three options can be used in causative constructions to indicate that the director caused the action to happen. Specifically:
 
 1. 'let' is used to show permission, and the sentence 'The director let us check the schedule carefully.' is grammatically correct and natural.
 2. 'had' is used in a causative construction meaning he arranged or caused us to check the schedule.
 3. 'got' (usually followed by 'to') is also used to indicate causing someone to do something, as in 'The director got us to check the schedule carefully.'
 
 Since each option fits the given meaning when used in its proper causative sense, all three are acceptable.",,,
1,906,harder,,,,,,
1,907,were,,,,,,
1,908,so that,in order,,"Both 'so that' and 'in order' convey the purpose behind the action, matching the intent of the Korean sentence which suggests that the mural was painted for the purpose of allowing students to appreciate art. 'Because' is not appropriate in this context as it explains a reason rather than indicating purpose.",,,
1,909,whose,,,,,,
1,910,Listening,,,,,,
1,911,what,,,The sentence 'They achieved what they hoped' is grammatically correct and conveys that they achieved the thing they had hoped for. 'Which' and 'that' do not work naturally in this context.,,,
1,912,can be,could be,,"The Korean sentence indicates that organic waste has the ability to be turned into energy, which corresponds to a possibility. 'Can be' directly matches this sense of ability or possibility. 'Could be' also indicates a possibility, albeit with a slightly less assertive tone, and may be acceptable in contexts implying a hypothetical situation. 'Should be' implies obligation or an expected outcome, which does not align with the intended meaning.",,,
1,913,cherished,,,,,,
1,914,since,,,,,,
1,915,when to start,,,,,,
1,916,Plant,,,,,,
1,917,while,,,,,,
1,918,gave,had given,,"Both 'gave' and 'had given' can be considered correct in this sentence.
 
 1. 'Gave' is a simple past form that directly reports the fact of the speech, which fits the narrative style.
 2. 'Had given' uses the past perfect to emphasize that the speech occurred before the report was made, aligning well with reported speech conventions.
 
 Option 3, 'has given', is not appropriate because it implies a connection to the present, which doesn't suit the context of a past event.",,,
1,919,upset,,,"The word 'upset' correctly matches the Korean sentence meaning, which indicates being angry or disturbed due to a mistake, while 'happy' and 'calm' do not convey the intended emotional state.",,,
1,920,meant,,,,,,
1,921,can't wait to,,,"The phrase 'can't wait to' fits perfectly with the context of being excited about an upcoming trip, as indicated by the Korean sentence '여행을 정말 기대하고 있어!'. The other options either indicate a negative sentiment or hesitancy, which doesn't match the enthusiastic tone of the sentence.",,,
1,922,I heard that,I’ve heard that,,Both 'I heard that' and 'I’ve heard that' correctly convey the idea that the speaker has received information about the movie's quality. The sentence is reporting hearsay. 'I can say that' does not fit because it suggests the speaker is providing a personal opinion rather than relaying what they have heard.,,,
1,923,It is said that,,,"The expression 'It is said that' is a natural way to report hearsay or commonly held beliefs, which matches the Korean sentence '아침에 물을 마시는 것이 건강에 좋다고 해요.' This phrase accurately conveys the meaning that it is reported or believed that drinking water in the morning is beneficial for health. The other options do not fit as naturally in this context.",,,
1,924,leave,,,,,,
1,925,difficult,,,"The Korean sentence asks if waking up early is considered difficult. 'Difficult' is the most appropriate choice as it directly translates to '어렵다', which aligns with the meaning of the Korean text. 'Fun' and 'easy' do not convey the intended challenge of waking up early.",,,
1,926,visit,,,,,,
1,927,tell me more about,,,"The Korean sentence asks for more details about the job, which is best captured by 'tell me more about.' Although 'describe' and 'discuss' could technically be used, they do not fully convey the request for additional information in the natural way that 'tell me more about' does.",,,
1,928,say,,,,,,
1,929,stress,worry,,"Both 'worry' and 'stress' can naturally complete the sentence and convey the meaning of not being anxious about the test. 'Worry' directly translates to 걱정하다 in Korean, matching the given phrase. 'Stress' is also commonly used in casual speech to mean feeling anxious or concerned, making it an acceptable alternative. 'Panic', however, implies an extreme reaction and does not fit as well in this context.",,,
1,930,won,,,,,,
1,931,like,,,"The word 'like' is the most appropriate insertion since the Korean sentence '이 새 레스토랑은 어때요?' translates to asking someone's opinion about the restaurant. 'Like' in this context means to regard it favorably or unfavorably. The other options, 'visit' and 'hate', do not logically complete the sentence.",,,
1,932,studied harder,,,,,,
1,933,change,,,,,,
1,934,visit,,,,,,
1,935,what,,,,,,
1,936,to explore,,,,,,
1,937,whether,,,"The word 'whether' is the best fit because it is used to introduce alternative possibilities in indirect questions. In the sentence, 'not sure whether it would rain' correctly expresses uncertainty about the possibility of rain. 'If' is typically used for conditional clauses, and using it again after 'if I was not sure' can create ambiguity, while 'that' does not fit the grammatical structure at all.",,,
1,938,organized,,,"The correct choice is 'organized' because it is the past participle form needed in a passive construction. In the sentence, 'a concert organized by local talents' correctly indicates that the local talents arranged the concert. 'Organize' is the base form and 'organizes' is the third-person singular present tense, neither of which are appropriate in this passive context.",,,
1,939,thinking,,,"The present participle 'thinking' is the most suitable in this sentence as it indicates that the review of the case files was done while contemplating the reasons behind the events. 'Thinking' pairs naturally with the structure of the sentence, matching the intention expressed in the Korean translation.",,,
1,940,is,,,,,,
1,941,As,,,,,,

1,947,can,,,,,,
1,948,cleaned,,,,,,
1,949,bring,,,,,,
1,950,with a tail shining,,,"The phrase 'with a tail shining' is the most grammatically correct and natural option in this context. It clearly conveys that the comet possesses a tail that is shining, matching the description given in the Korean sentence. Option 1 is less natural due to the omission of the article 'a', and Option 3 is incorrect because 'shine' is not used as an adjective in this construction.",,,
1,951,happy,glad,,"Both 'happy' and 'glad' correctly express that positive emotion of being pleased. The Korean sentence indicates joy about someone arriving safely, which aligns with both options. 'Worried' does not work because it implies concern rather than happiness.",,,
1,952,Absolutely,You can say that again.,,"Both 'Absolutely' and 'You can say that again.' serve as natural expressions of agreement in response to the statement about the nice weather. 'Absolutely' is a straightforward affirmative response, while 'You can say that again.' is an idiomatic expression that also conveys strong agreement with the observation. 'That's exactly right.' is less commonly used in this casual context for expressing agreement about the weather.",,,
1,953,like better,,,"The phrase 'like better' fits naturally into the blank since the structure '___ better' expects a verb phrase that already incorporates the comparative element. While 'prefer' is also a valid verb for expressing favor, it does not pair naturally with 'better' (i.e., one would simply say 'Which do you prefer?' rather than 'Which do you prefer better?'). Similarly, 'enjoy more' would be grammatically awkward when combined with 'better' since 'more' already serves a comparative function. Therefore, 'like better' is the most appropriate choice.",,,
1,954,your trip,,,,,,
1,955,I'd like to talk about,,,,,,
1,956,makes,,,,,,
1,957,if,whether,,"Both 'if' and 'whether' can be used in indirect questions to convey uncertainty about a future event. In the sentence, 'I wonder if she will come to the party' and 'I wonder whether she will come to the party' are grammatically correct and commonly used. The option 'when' would imply a certainty of attendance, which does not match the intended meaning of the question.",,,
1,958,carry,,,"The most natural choice here is 'carry'. In the context of the sentence 'Do you want me to ___ your bag?' and the Korean translation '내가 네 가방 들어줄까?', 'carry' best conveys the meaning of transporting the bag. 'Lift' typically implies raising something from a lower to a higher level, and 'hold' can imply grasping or keeping something in one's arms temporarily. Therefore, 'carry' is the most appropriate choice.",,,
1,959,recommend,,,,,,
1,960,I'm looking forward to,I can't wait for,,"Both 'I'm looking forward to' and 'I can't wait for' appropriately express the sentiment of eagerly anticipating the weekend, which matches the Korean sentence '주말을 기대하고 있어.'
 
 1. 'I'm looking forward to' is a common phrase used to indicate that someone is excited about an upcoming event or time, making it a natural fit in this sentence.
 2. 'I can't wait for' similarly conveys a strong sense of anticipation and excitement for the weekend.
 
 On the other hand, 'I'm excited about' typically expresses enthusiasm but is less commonly used to denote anticipation for a period of time like the weekend. Therefore, options 2 and 3 are the most suitable answers.",,,
1,961,If I were you,,,"The phrase 'If I were you' is the correct grammatical expression used for giving advice. 'If you were me' reverses the perspective, and 'If I was you' is less formal and grammatically less accurate in this context.",,,
1,962,open,,,,,,
1,963,forget,,,,,,
1,964,do,,,,,,
1,965,should have studied harder,,,,,,
1,966,mistaken,wrong,,"Both 'mistaken' and 'wrong' naturally complete the sentence 'I’m afraid you’re __________.' in a way that corresponds to the Korean phrase '틀렸어요', which means that what has been stated is incorrect. 'I’m afraid you’re mistaken' is a common and polite expression to indicate error, and 'I’m afraid you’re wrong' conveys a similar idea in a slightly more direct manner. 'Incorrect' is less idiomatic in this context, making 'mistaken' and 'wrong' the better choices.",,,
1,967,what,,,,,,
1,968,trotting,,,,,,
1,969,been,,,,,,
1,970,when we meet on Friday evenings,,,"The Korean sentence specifies the condition as '금요일 저녁에 만날 때' which directly translates to 'when we meet on Friday evenings'. This matches the context of the sentence, whereas 'if we meet on Friday evenings' and 'after we meet on Friday evenings' do not precisely align with the meaning conveyed in the Korean version.",,,
1,971,had finished,,,"The sentence describes an action that was completed before another past action (the movie started). The past perfect tense ('had finished') is the correct form to indicate that the homework was completed prior to the movie starting. 'Finished' (simple past) does not clearly establish the sequence of events, and 'have finished' (present perfect) is not appropriate for a past event. Therefore, 'had finished' is the best choice.",,,
1,972,essential,,,,,,
1,973,looking,,,The option 'looking' is correct because it functions as a present participle that gives extra information about the action of riding the bus. It correctly implies that the speaker is doing the action of 'looking both ways' concurrently with riding the bus. The other options 'look' and 'looked' do not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.,,,
1,974,must have been,,,"The phrase 'must have been' is grammatically correct for expressing a past deduction. 'Must being' is incorrect because 'being' does not fit the perfect construction, and 'must has been' is incorrect due to the use of 'has' with the modal 'must'.",,,
1,975,heard,,,,,,
1,976,Because,Since,,Both 'Because' and 'Since' are acceptable choices since they indicate a reason or cause. The Korean sentence explains that the puppy’s loud barking is the reason why people admired its cuteness. 'Though' would be inappropriate as it suggests contrast rather than causation.,,,
1,977,so exciting,,,,,,
1,978,if,,,The word 'if' correctly fits the structure of the sentence by introducing an indirect yes/no question (I wonder if my parents will visit this weekend). 'Because' and 'until' do not work grammatically in this sentence.,,,
1,979,my friend,,,,,,
1,980,had,,,,,,
1,981,will,,,,,,
1,982,who,,,,,,
1,983,How are you feeling?,How do you feel?,,"Both 'How are you feeling?' and 'How do you feel?' are natural ways to ask about one's current mood or state, matching the Korean question '기분이 어때?'.
 
 1. 'How are you feeling?' is a common expression to inquire about someone's emotional or physical state, fitting the context of being excited.
 2. 'How do you feel?' also works well in asking about one's current feelings and is acceptable in informal conversation.
 
 'Are you feeling well?' is less appropriate because it implies asking about general health rather than mood.",,,
1,984,glad,,,,,,
1,985,discuss,talk,,"Both 'discuss' and 'talk' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Discuss' implies a more in-depth conversation about plans, which works well in the context of planning a trip, while 'talk' is a more casual option that also aligns with the Korean phrase '이야기하자'. 'Chat' is typically used for even more informal conversation and is less likely to be the intended choice in this context.",,,
1,986,helping,,,"The phrase 'Thank you for helping me' is the most natural and commonly used expression in English. While 'assisting' might be technically correct, it is less common in everyday spoken language, and 'guiding' doesn't convey the intended meaning of providing general help.",,,
1,987,looking forward to,,,"The phrase 'looking forward to' is the best fit because it directly expresses the anticipation described in the Korean sentence '나는 여름 방학을 기대하고 있어.' While 'excited for' could be considered, it is less idiomatic in this context, and 'waiting for' does not convey the intended nuance of eager anticipation.",,,
1,988,fingers,,,,,,
1,989,disappointed,,,,,,
1,990,should,,,,,,
1,991,curious,,,"The Korean sentence '나는 우주 탐사에 대해 궁금해' directly translates to 'I’m curious about space exploration', which makes 'curious' the appropriate choice. 'Excited' and 'bored' do not accurately convey the intended meaning of being inquisitive or interested in space exploration.",,,
1,992,being environmentally friendly,,,,,,
1,993,like,prefer,,"Both 'like' and 'prefer' can be appropriately used to ask about one's inclination when choosing between coffee and tea. 'Prefer' is a direct match to the meaning of the Korean sentence (선호해요), implying a stronger choice or inclination, while 'like' is also common in conversational English when asking for someone's preference. 'Choose' is less suitable as it conveys the act of selecting rather than expressing a preference.",,,
1,994,I hate,,,,,,
1,995,online classes,,,,,,
1,996,I don't,,,,,,
1,997,rude,,,,,,
1,998,Relax!,Calm down!,,"Both 'Relax!' and 'Calm down!' are suitable translations for '진정해!', which implies a request to calm or settle down. 'Keep quiet!' does not directly match the meaning, as it primarily instructs silence rather than calming down.",,,
1,999,what makes you smile,,,The phrase 'what makes you smile' fits best because the sentence asks about a general characteristic that induces laughter. 'What did make you smile' incorrectly uses the past tense and 'what makes you smiled' is grammatically incorrect.,,,
1,1000,repaired,had repaired,,"Both 'repaired' and 'had repaired' appropriately indicate that the friend's action occurred before the speaker's feeling of relief. In the sentence, the event of repairing the bench happened prior to the speaker's relief, so using the simple past 'repaired' is acceptable if the sequence is clear from context, while the past perfect 'had repaired' explicitly establishes the earlier time of the repairing. 'Has repaired' is not suitable because the present perfect does not match the past context of the sentence.",,,
1,1001,enough,,,,,,
1,1002,Seeing,,,,,,

1,1004,happier,,,,,,
1,1005,was explaining,,,,,,
1,1006,Some,,,,,,
1,1007,which always uplift my mood,,,"The relative clause 'which always uplift my mood' correctly refers back to the preceding clause about the messages. Option 2 maintains proper grammatical construction and meaning, as it provides additional information about the messages. Option 1 is not grammatically appropriate, and option 3 uses 'whom', which is incorrect in this context because it should refer to a person, not the messages.",,,
1,1008,much cleaner,,,"The Korean sentence includes '훨씬', indicating a stronger comparison, which is best captured by 'much cleaner'. 'Cleaner' does indicate a comparative form but doesn't emphasize the extent, and 'more cleaner' is grammatically incorrect.",,,
1,1009,joke,,,,,,
1,1010,what,,,,,,
1,1011,whose,,,,,,
1,1012,this,,,"The sentence refers to a specific, singular source of renewable energy that powers the community. 'This' is used to indicate something near or previously mentioned, which fits the context. 'That' would typically refer to something more distant or less immediate, and 'these' is plural, which does not match the singular noun 'renewable energy'.",,,
1,1013,genuine,,,"The word 'genuine' is an adjective that correctly describes the proposal in the sentence. 'Genuinely' is an adverb and does not correctly modify 'proposal,' while 'fact' is a noun and does not fit grammatically.",,,
1,1014,asked,,,,,,
1,1015,Can you tell me about,,,,,,
1,1016,most,,,,,,
1,1017,Can I get your advice on,,,,,,
1,1018,forget,,,,,,
1,1019,sure,,,,,,
1,1020,I suppose,It seems to me,,"Both 'I suppose' and 'It seems to me' appropriately introduce a personal opinion or observation that matches the nuance of the Korean sentence '내가 보기에는 그녀는 매우 재능이 있어 보인다.'
 
 1. 'I suppose' is commonly used to express an opinion or assumption, which fits the context of judging someone's talent.
 2. 'It seems to me' also indicates a personal impression or viewpoint, making it equally fitting.
 3. 'Honestly' does not grammatically or naturally introduce the clause in the given sentence, and its usage here does not align with the intended meaning of expressing an observation.
 
 Thus, 'I suppose' and 'It seems to me' are the correct choices.",,,
1,1021,If I were you,,,,,,
1,1022,park,,,"The Korean sentence ""여기 주차하면 안 돼"" means that parking is not allowed. Among the options, only 'park' fits the context of prohibiting parking in a particular area.",,,
1,1023,know about climate change,,,,,,
1,1024,excited about,looking forward,,"Both 'excited about' and 'looking forward' express anticipation and match the Korean sentence ‘나는 콘서트를 기대하고 있어’, which conveys an excited or eager expectation for the concert. 'Waiting for' does not convey the same emotional nuance and is less appropriate in this context.",,,
1,1025,Let's talk about,Let's discuss,,"Both 'Let's talk about' and 'Let's discuss' are appropriate in this context because the Korean phrase '이야기해보자' conveys the idea of having a discussion about the travel plans. 'Let's talk about' naturally invites conversation, and 'Let's discuss' similarly means to converse about something. On the other hand, 'Let's plan for' implies organizing or scheduling the travel, which does not align as closely with the conversational tone indicated by the Korean sentence.",,,
1,1026,suggest,,,,,,
1,1027,turning down,,,"The choice 'turning down' is correct because the Korean sentence asks to lower the volume. 'Playing loudly' and 'turning up' are opposite in meaning, as they both imply increasing the volume, while 'turning down' appropriately indicates reducing it.",,,

1,1035,early job experience,,,,,,
1,1036,to,,,,,,
1,1037,saw,had seen,,"Both 'saw' and 'had seen' can be used in this sentence. 'Saw' is the simple past tense and works naturally with 'remembered' to describe the dream experienced during the national parade. 'Had seen' uses the past perfect tense to indicate that the act of seeing the dream occurred before the act of remembering it, which is also grammatically acceptable in this context. 'See' is not acceptable as it is in the present tense and does not match the past tense required by the context.",,,
1,1038,explains,,,,,,
1,1039,how,,,,,,
1,1040,"Using simple patterns,",,,,,,
1,1041,had,,,,,,
1,1042,what,,,"The blank requires a word that introduces a clause acting as the subject. 'What motivates me most' is a common construction used to denote 'the thing that motivates me most'.
 1. 'That' does not function correctly in this context because it does not properly introduce a defining clause referring to the motivating factor.
 2. 'Which' typically refers back to a specific, previously mentioned noun, and here there is no clear antecedent.
 Thus, 'what' is the best choice as it naturally introduces the clause describing the motivating factor.",,,
1,1043,reading,read,,"Both 'reading' and 'read' are acceptable in this sentence but each conveys a slightly different nuance. 'Reading' is a present participle that emphasizes an ongoing action (which aligns well with the Korean phrasing that describes the friend who was in the process of reading a book). 'Read' (the bare infinitive following a perception verb) can also be used to indicate that the friend was observed performing the action. 'Reads' is not suitable here because it uses the simple present tense, which does not correctly describe the observed or ongoing action in this context.",,,
1,1044,had,,,,,,
1,1045,would have enjoyed,,,,,,
1,1046,so that,,,"The sentence expresses a purpose: I study our history every day in order to feel the deep love for my country. 'So that' effectively indicates this intended result or purpose, matching the Korean construction '공부해서' which implies a consequential relationship. 'Because' would denote a reason for studying, which does not match the sentence structure, and 'if' does not fit grammatically.",,,
1,1047,happy,,,,,,
1,1048,more honest,,,"The sentence follows a comparative structure ('The ____ you are, the more trust you gain'), which requires a comparative adjective to pair with 'more'. 'More honest' correctly fits the comparative form needed. 'Most honest' is a superlative form and does not align with the comparative structure, while 'honest' is a base adjective and lacks the comparative nuance.",,,
1,1049,visiting,,,,,,
1,1050,can,could,,"Both 'can' and 'could' may be acceptable in this sentence depending on the intended nuance. 'Could' is typically used as the past form of 'can' when reporting a question, which fits the reported speech construction ('She asked if she could help the community'). On the other hand, 'can' might also be used if the speaker intended to emphasize the subject's current ability or permission, making both options potentially correct. 'Will' is not suitable because it implies a future intention rather than the capability or permission suggested by the Korean sentence.",,,
1,1051,How,,,,,,
1,1052,Have you heard of,,,,,,
1,1053,agree,,,,,,
1,1054,Don't worry,,,,,,
1,1055,be honest,,,,,,
1,1056,should have bought,,,"The Korean sentence '나는 더 큰 것을 샀어야 했어' translates to 'I should have bought a bigger one.' The correct option must convey regret or an ought-to-have-been action, which 'should have bought' does. 'Could have bought' implies a possibility rather than an obligation, and 'would have bought' implies a conditional intent, making them less suitable in this context.",,,
1,1057,have to,,,,,,
1,1058,can,,,,,,
1,1059,mean,,,,,,
1,1060,options,,,"The Korean sentence uses '옵션', which aligns directly with the English 'options'. Although 'alternatives' can sometimes be used to indicate additional choices, the context and the specific Korean wording suggest 'options' is the most appropriate and natural choice. 'Selections' does not fit as well in this context.",,,
1,1061,sit,,,,,,
1,1062,you can’t,,,,,,
1,1063,wonder,,,,,,
1,1064,Let me see...,Let me think.,,"Both 'Let me see...' and 'Let me think.' are natural hesitation phrases used when someone needs a moment to decide, matching the Korean emphasis on taking a moment. Option 1 'Give me some time to think.' is more of a request rather than a mere expression of hesitation, so it does not fit as naturally in the given context.",,,
1,1065,Would,Could,,"Both 'Would' and 'Could' are used to make polite requests in English, which matches the polite Korean sentence asking for repetition. 'Would you say that again?' and 'Could you say that again?' are both grammatically and contextually appropriate ways to request someone to repeat themselves. 'Can you say that again?' is less appropriate in this context as it is often considered more direct and less formal.",,,
1,1066,suggest,recommend,,"Both 'suggest' and 'recommend' correctly complete the sentence. In this context, 'recommend' directly translates to the Korean word '추천' and fits perfectly, while 'suggest' can also be used in a similar way to propose a good book. 'Explain' does not fit the meaning of advising or proposing a book.",,,
1,1067,excited,,,,,,
1,1068,believing that studying consistently makes him smarter,,,,,,
1,1069,more,,,,,,
1,1070,Although,,,"The word 'Although' is the correct answer because it introduces a contrast between the school's warning and the occurrence of a minor accident, which is in line with the meaning of the Korean sentence that starts with '비록' (although). 'Because' would indicate a cause and effect which does not match the intended contrast, and 'If' does not logically fit the sentence structure.",,,
1,1071,What,,,,,,
1,1072,useful,,,,,,
1,1073,did not spend wisely,,,,,,
1,1074,not only,,,"The phrase 'not only ... but also' is a common correlative conjunction pair used to connect two complementary characteristics. In the sentence, 'Fruit salad is not only refreshing but also nutritious' logically and grammatically expresses both qualities of the fruit salad.",,,
1,1075,not to waste,,,"The sentence in Korean means 'She promised not to waste her energy.' Option 'not to waste' correctly reflects the negation and infinitive structure used to indicate the promise. Option 'to waste' would imply a promise to waste energy, which is opposite of the intended meaning, and 'not waste' is not grammatically correct in this context.",,,
1,1076,if,,,,,,
1,1077,exercise,exercising,,"Both 'exercise' and 'exercising' are acceptable in this sentence. 'Exercise' as a noun can directly refer to the activity that keeps one healthy, fitting naturally into the structure 'It is exercise that keeps me healthy.' Alternatively, 'exercising' as a gerund also functions as a noun in this context, conveying the act of engaging in physical activity. The option 'exercised' is not appropriate as it is the past tense form and doesn't convey the intended meaning.",,,
1,1078,act,,,,,,
1,1079,have been,,,,,,
1,1080,had saved,,,,,,
1,1081,so that I can understand,,,"The phrase 'so that I can understand' correctly conveys the intended meaning of being able to understand the lesson better, which fits with the Korean sentence about improving understanding. Option 1 ('so that I understand') does not clearly indicate the potential or ability aspect, and Option 3 is grammatically incorrect.",,,
1,1082,While,,,,,,
1,1083,plan,,,,,,
1,1084,want,need,,"Both 'want' and 'need' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Do you want me to carry your bag?' is a common way to offer help, and 'Do you need me to carry your bag?' implies that help might be required. 'Expect' is not suitable because it implies an obligation or assumption rather than an offer.",,,
1,1085,makes,,,The phrase 'What makes you interested in history?' is the only grammatically correct and natural-sounding option available. 'Does' and 'is' do not fit the context or structure of the sentence.,,,
1,1086,mind,,,,,,
1,1087,something,anything,,"Both 'something' and 'anything' can be used in this context depending on the nuance desired. 'Something' is often used when the speaker suspects that there might be an issue, which fits the informal inquiry implied by '무슨 일 있어?'. 'Anything' is also grammatically acceptable in a yes/no question format and can be used to ask if there is any particular issue bothering the person. 'Everything' is less likely since it would imply that all things are bothering the person, which is not consistent with the typical use of the phrase.",,,
1,1088,wear,,,,,,
1,1089,wonder,,,,,,
1,1090,explain,,,,,,
1,1091,worried,,,"Both option_1 and option_3 are the same word, 'worried', and it correctly fills the blank in the sentence 'I'm worried about my math test.' The sentence expresses a feeling of concern, which aligns with the Korean phrase '나는 수학 시험이 걱정돼.' On the other hand, option_2 'nervous afraid' is not a proper adjective form for this context.",,,
1,1092,don’t,,,,,,
1,1093,satisfied,happy,,"Both 'satisfied' and 'happy' fit naturally in the sentence to express that the speaker is not content with the haircut. 'Satisfied' emphasizes a lack of contentment or approval, while 'happy' similarly conveys a sense of displeasure. 'Fine' is less commonly used in this context, making the answer options 'satisfied' and 'happy' the most appropriate choices.",,,
1,1094,won’t,,,,,,
1,1095,mean,,,,,,
1,1096,could,,,,,,
1,1097,What,,,"The clause 'what she said inspired many people' functions as a noun clause acting as the subject of the sentence. 'What' correctly introduces this clause meaning 'the thing that she said.' The other options, 'that' and 'which,' do not convey the same meaning or grammatical structure in this context.",,,
1,1098,Even though,Although,,"Both 'Even though' and 'Although' appropriately set up a contrast between being sick and going to school, which matches the meaning of the Korean sentence. 'Because' would incorrectly imply a cause-effect relationship rather than a contrast.",,,
1,1099,Tom,,,,,,
1,1100,who,,,,,,
1,1101,sitting,,,,,,
1,1102,does,,,,,,
1,1103,where,,,,,,
1,1104,had,,,"The correct answer is 'had' because the sentence is written in the past perfect tense, which is used to describe an action that was completed before another past event. 'By the time we arrived' indicates a specific point in the past, so 'had already started' is the correct form. 'Has' and 'have' are present perfect forms and do not fit the context.",,,
1,1105,Feeling,,,,,,
1,1106,but,,,"In the structure 'not only ... but also', the coordinating conjunction 'but' properly links the two positive descriptors. 'And' and 'or' do not fit this widely recognized pattern.",,,
1,1107,where,,,,,,
1,1108,However,,,,,,
1,1109,whose,,,,,,
1,1110,were,,,"The sentence expresses a hypothetical situation using the subjunctive mood. In standard English, 'were' is used instead of 'was' in such counterfactual conditional statements. 'Is' is incorrect because it indicates a real condition, not a hypothetical one.",,,
2,1,come,,,,,,
2,2,like,,,,,,
2,3,planning,,,,,,
2,4,find,,,,,,
2,5,study harder,,,"The Korean sentence implies that it's a good idea to study hard (공부를 열심히 하는 것이 좋은 생각이야). Option 2, 'study harder', is the closest match in meaning, while the other options refer to actions that do not align with the context of studying.",,,
2,6,borrow,,,"The context of the sentence requires asking if you can temporarily use someone's eraser. 'Borrow' means to take something with the intention of returning it, which fits the question correctly. 'Lend' would imply giving the eraser to someone else, and 'buy' is inappropriate because it implies a purchase.",,,
2,7,fantastic,,,,,,
2,8,because,,,"The sentence explains the reason why the bus was missed, which directly corresponds to the Korean sentence stating that it's because the alarm didn't go off. 'Because' is the only option that fits grammatically and semantically.",,,
2,9,a doctor,,,,,,
2,10,Stay,Remain,,"Both 'Stay' and 'Remain' naturally complete the sentence as common expressions used to encourage someone to be positive. While 'Keep a positive attitude' is a common phrase, the simplified form 'Keep positive' in this context is less commonly used. Thus, 'Stay positive' and 'Remain positive' are the more natural and acceptable choices.",,,
2,11,What's your opinion on,How do you feel about,,"Both 'What's your opinion on' and 'How do you feel about' correctly match the intent of the question, which asks for a personal perspective about the pizza. The Korean sentence '이 피자에 대해 어떻게 느껴?' implies asking someone's feelings or opinion. 'I believe it's' is a statement rather than a question, making it less suitable in this context.",,,
2,12,are not allowed,,,,,,
2,13,try,,,,,,
2,14,is warm,,,"The phrase 'is warm' directly corresponds to the Korean clue '따뜻하지', which means 'is warm'. This makes it the most appropriate option to complete the sentence.",,,
2,15,is,,,,,,
2,16,visiting,,,,,,
2,17,spent,,,,,,
2,18,gave,provided,,"Both 'gave' and 'provided' correctly complete the sentence. 'Gave' is a straightforward and natural fit that directly matches the intended meaning of supplying something useful, as mentioned in the Korean sentence. 'Provided' also works well because it conveys the act of giving or supplying a useful tip. 'Shared' is less appropriate in this context because it typically requires a different structure (e.g., 'shared with us') and is more commonly used in contexts involving exchange rather than simply giving.",,,
2,19,best,,,,,,
2,20,to sketch nature,,,,,,
2,21,delightful,,,"The word 'delightful' fits naturally in the exclamatory sentence 'How delightful the characters appear!', which expresses admiration for the enjoyable appearance of the characters. 'Delighting' is generally used to describe something that is causing delight but is less common as an adjective in this structure, and 'delighted' refers to a state of being pleased rather than describing the characters' appearance.",,,
2,22,don't,,,"In this sentence, the subject 'I' requires the base form 'do not' contracted to 'don't'. The option 'doesn't' is used with third-person singular subjects (he, she, it) and 'do' without negation does not convey the intended meaning. Thus, 'don't' is the only correct choice.",,,
2,23,will,,,,,,
2,24,collecting,,,,,,
2,25,to visit,,,"In this sentence, the correct grammatical form is 'to visit', which fits the structure 'plans to visit'. The other options ('visit' and 'visiting') do not grammatically complement the verb 'plans' when describing intended future actions.",,,
2,26,that,,,,,,
2,27,was,,,,,,
2,28,warm,,,,,,
2,29,nice,,,The phrase 'nice to meet you' is a standard greeting corresponding to the Korean sentence '만나서 반갑습니다.' where 'nice' is used to express being pleased to meet someone. 'Happy' and 'sad' do not fit the intended meaning of the greeting.,,,
2,30,reading,,,,,,
2,31,going to,plan to,intend to,"All three options express a planned future action, which fits the meaning of the Korean sentence '나는 여행할 계획이야.'
 
 1. 'going to' is commonly used for near-future plans and implies that the speaker has already made some arrangements.
 2. 'plan to' directly relates to having a plan or intention, matching the explicit expression of intent in the Korean sentence.
 3. 'intend to' also conveys a firm intention to do something in the future. 
 
 Thus, all three options are acceptable answers.",,,
2,32,enjoy learning about,,,,,,
2,33,has to,must,,"Both 'has to' and 'must' express obligation, which matches the meaning of the Korean phrase '완성해야 한다.' The sentence indicates that completing the assignment is required. 'Can' would merely indicate possibility rather than obligation, which is not suitable in this context.",,,
2,34,try,,,,,,
2,35,Great,Excellent,,"Both 'Great work!' and 'Excellent work!' are common expressions used to compliment someone on their performance. In the context of the quiz, each fits naturally following 'Well done!'. 'Fine work!' is less commonly used as a congratulatory remark compared to the other two, making 'Great' and 'Excellent' the most suitable choices.",,,
2,36,coffee,,,"The sentence offers an alternative beverage to tea. Since tea is already mentioned, 'coffee' is a natural alternative commonly served in similar settings. 'Juice' is less typical in this context, and repeating 'tea' would be redundant. Therefore, 'coffee' is the most appropriate choice.",,,
2,37,Since,Because,,"Both 'Since' and 'Because' are grammatically and contextually appropriate in this sentence as they indicate a cause-effect relationship, aligning with the Korean sentence that explains the reason behind the action. 'However' does not fit because it implies contrast rather than causation.",,,
2,38,incredible,unbelievable,,"Both 'incredible' and 'unbelievable' are adjectives commonly used to express astonishment and admiration, which fits the context of the exclamation 'I can’t believe it! That’s _______!'. 'Incredible' conveys the sense of something being extraordinary or amazing, while 'unbelievable' reinforces the disbelief expressed in the first sentence. 'Surprising' would not be as fitting because it implies an element of unexpectedness rather than the extreme admiration indicated by the Korean phrase '정말 굉장해요!'.",,,
2,39,sorry,,,,,,
2,40,helping,,,,,,
2,41,doesn't she?,,,The sentence tag for 'She likes tea' needs an auxiliary that confirms the verb phrase 'likes'. 'Doesn't she?' is the appropriate inversion for a third-person singular affirmative sentence. 'Isn't she?' does not match the verb 'likes' and 'don't they?' is incorrect since the subject is singular.,,,
2,42,history,,,,,,
2,43,big,,,,,,
2,44,the museum,,,,,,
2,45,playing,,,"The sentence 'My friend enjoys playing basketball' uses the gerund form, which is required after the verb 'enjoy'. 'Play' and 'played' do not grammatically fit in this context.",,,
2,46,going to,,,,,,
2,47,that,,,"The option 'that' fits naturally in the sentence as it introduces the subordinate clause 'a kind word heals wounds.' The other options, 'if' and 'but', do not grammatically or logically match the context of the sentence.",,,
2,48,to,,,,,,
2,49,and,,,,,,
2,50,too old,,,,,,
2,51,was,,,,,,
2,52,clearest,,,,,,
2,53,my close friend,,,,,,
2,54,to plan,,,,,,
2,55,should,,,,,,
2,56,tasty,,,,,,
2,57,goes off,,,The phrase 'goes off' is the correct form in this sentence because 'alarm' is a singular noun and requires the third person singular form of the verb. 'Go off' (option_2) is grammatically incorrect and 'is off' (option_3) does not convey the meaning of the alarm ringing.,,,
2,58,give,,,,,,
2,59,doesn't it?,,,,,,
2,60,one,,,,,,
2,61,Glad,Pleased,,"Both 'Glad' and 'Pleased' produce natural and common greetings in English when paired with 'to meet you'.
 
 1. 'Pleased to meet you' is a very standard expression used when greeting someone.
 2. 'Glad to meet you' is also acceptable and conveys a similar sentiment.
 3. 'Happy' would be less common in this context, as it is more typically used to describe feelings rather than serve as a polite greeting in this structure.",,,
2,62,like,,,,,,
2,63,find,,,,,,
2,64,doing,,,,,,
2,65,helping,,,,,,
2,66,take a break,,,,,,
2,67,up to,,,"Option 'up to' forms the common expression 'What were you up to?', which correctly translates the Korean sentence asking what someone was doing.",,,
2,68,What,,,,,,
2,69,cloudy,,,,,,
2,70,get some rest,,,,,,
2,71,read,,,,,,
2,72,a doctor,,,,,,
2,73,planning to,going to,,"Both 'planning to' and 'going to' naturally complete the sentence 'What are you ____ do this weekend?' while fitting the intended meaning of discussing planned activities. 'Planning to' emphasizes the idea of organizing or scheduling an activity, and 'going to' is a common form for expressing a future plan. The option 'will' does not fit grammatically in the context of the present continuous form of the question.",,,
2,74,wonderful,,,,,,
2,75,this idea,,,,,,
2,76,different,,,The word 'different' fits best since the Korean sentence implies '다른 의견' which translates directly to 'different opinion'. 'Similar' and 'equal' do not carry the intended meaning.,,,
2,77,is,,,,,,
2,78,join,,,,,,
2,79,Remember,,,"The phrase 'Remember the wise words.' is an imperative sentence giving a command or suggestion, making 'Remember' the correct form. 'Remembers' is incorrect because it would imply third person singular which does not match the imperative structure, and 'Remembered' is the past tense which is not appropriate here.",,,
2,80,prepared,,,,,,
2,81,Cooking,,,"The correct answer is 'Cooking' because the gerund form is required to denote the action of cooking as a subject. 'Cook' would be interpreted as an imperative or a noun referring to a person, and 'Cooked' is an adjective or past participle which does not fit in the sentence.",,,
2,82,organize,,,,,,
2,83,going to,,,,,,
2,84,that,,,,,,
2,85,likes,,,,,,
2,86,are reading,,,,,,
2,87,can,,,"The word 'can' is the correct answer because it functions as a modal verb indicating ability or possibility, which matches the meaning in the sentence 'I can gain new ideas from every tale.' The other options, 'canned' and 'cans', do not appropriately fit the grammatical context.",,,
2,88,are,,,"The sentence refers to multiple stars, so the plural form 'are' is needed. 'Is' is singular and 'was' indicates past tense, both of which do not match the sentence structure.",,,
2,89,exciting,,,"The option 'exciting' is the best fit because the sentence 'It appears exciting to try traditional outfits' correctly uses an adjective to describe the experience. 'Excited' would incorrectly describe a state of emotion rather than the experience itself, and 'excite' is a base verb form, which does not fit grammatically in this context.",,,

2,105,a used phone,a new backpack,an old hat,"All three options could be correct because the context of the question is open-ended. The seller might have any of these items, and none of the options is grammatically or contextually out of place in the sentence 'Yes, do you sell ___?'. Therefore, each option is a plausible answer.",,,
2,106,costs,,,,,,
2,107,opinion,,,,,,
2,108,learn about,know more about,,"Both 'learn about' and 'know more about' can be used to express the desire to gain additional information about the school festival, which mirrors the Korean phrase '더 알고 싶어'.
 
 1. 'Know more about' directly translates the idea of wanting additional knowledge or information about something.
 2. 'Learn about' also conveys a similar meaning of acquiring more details or understanding of the event.
 3. 'Tell me about' does not fit because it implies requesting someone else to provide information rather than expressing a personal interest in obtaining information.",,,
2,109,are,,,,,,
2,110,are,,,"The subject 'they' is a plural subject, and only 'are' is grammatically correct for forming the present continuous tense with a plural subject.",,,
2,111,can,,,,,,
2,112,enjoyed,,,,,,
2,113,won't,,,,,,
2,114,to learn,,,,,,
2,115,sent,,,"The sentence is in past tense (as indicated by the Korean sentence), and 'sent' is the past tense form of 'send'. 'Sends' is present simple third person singular and 'send' is the base form. Thus, 'sent' is the correct answer.",,,
2,116,exploring,,,,,,
2,117,joins,,,,,,
2,118,more,,,,,,
2,119,prefer,,,,,,
2,120,myself,,,,,,
2,121,a few,,,"The noun 'magazines' is countable, and 'a few' is the correct quantifier for countable nouns. 'A little' is used with uncountable nouns, and 'much' is also for uncountable nouns or overly large quantities, so they do not fit in this context.",,,
2,122,was,,,The correct answer is 'was' because the sentence refers to a past situation. 'Was' properly indicates that the friend was in middle school at the time when she performed in the school play. The other options 'is' and 'will' do not match the past context of the event.,,,
2,123,has to,,,,,,
2,124,much,,,,,,
2,125,vibrant,,,,,,
2,126,Nice to see you,Great to see you,Good to see you,"All three options can naturally fill the blank in this context as casual greetings when meeting someone. In a self-introduction situation like this, phrases such as 'Nice to see you', 'Great to see you', and 'Good to see you' are all acceptable and commonly used, making them all possible correct answers.",,,
2,127,exciting,,,,,,
2,128,Look out,,,,,,
2,129,up to,,,The phrase 'what is John up to' is an idiomatic expression commonly used to ask what someone is doing at the moment. 'Around' and 'after' do not complete the sentence in a standard way.,,,
2,130,help,,,,,,
2,131,happy,excited,,"Both 'happy' and 'excited' can work well in this sentence. The speaker is reacting positively to the good news, and saying 'I'm so happy to hear that' is a common and natural expression, while 'I'm so excited to hear that' is also frequently used to express enthusiasm. The option 'sad' clearly contradicts the positive tone intended.",,,
2,132,planning to,going to,,"Both 'planning to' and 'going to' are acceptable in this context because they naturally indicate future intentions or plans. 
 1. 'Planning to' complements the answer 'I’m planning to learn Korean' and fits the structure of the question asking about future activities.
 2. 'Going to' is also commonly used to discuss future plans, making it a natural choice for the question 'What are you going to do in Korea?'
 3. 'Want to' does not fit well grammatically in this sentence structure as it typically requires a different construction (e.g., 'What do you want to do?').",,,
2,133,library,,,,,,
2,134,How long,,,,,,
2,135,know,,,,,,
2,136,cook,,,,,,
2,137,cake,,,"The phrase 'cake' is directly translated to '케이크' in the Korean sentence. The other options, 'candy' and 'pasta', do not match the context of the question asking about a cake, making 'cake' the only suitable choice.",,,
2,138,concerned,,,"The sentence 'I’m really concerned about it' naturally conveys worry, which directly corresponds to the Korean sentence '정말로 그것에 대해 걱정하고 있어.' The other options do not fit the context of worrying.",,,
2,139,need to,,,,,,
2,140,That,It,,"Both 'That' and 'It' are appropriate to use in the sentence '___ just happened.'
 
 1. 'That just happened' is a common expression used to refer to an event that has occurred, matching the informal nature of the Korean sentence.
 2. 'It just happened' is also a grammatically correct and natural way to express the occurrence of an event in the recent past.
 3. 'Here just happened' does not make sense in this context.
 
 Thus, 'That' and 'It' are both acceptable answers.",,,
2,141,take a class,,,,,,
2,142,is,,,"The correct answer is 'is' because Tom is a singular third person subject, and 'is' is the appropriate singular verb form in the present tense. 'Am' and 'are' are used with different subjects.",,,
2,143,Stop,,,,,,
2,144,brought,,,,,,
2,145,will,,,,,,
2,146,faster,,,"The sentence compares two items using 'than', which requires the comparative form of the adjective. 'Faster' is the appropriate comparative form, whereas 'fast' is the base form and 'fastest' is the superlative, making them unsuitable in this context.",,,

2,156,must trim,should trim,,"Both 'must trim' and 'should trim' suitably express the obligation implied in the Korean sentence '가지치기를 해야 해요', which indicates that she needs to trim the garden to keep it neat. 'Must trim' conveys a strong necessity, while 'should trim' also expresses the idea of an advisable action. 'Could trim', on the other hand, suggests a possibility rather than an obligation, making it a less appropriate choice.",,,

2,161,line up,,,,,,
2,162,like,,,"The sentence 'What do you ___ the most?' paired with the Korean translation '너는 무엇을 가장 좋아하니?' directly asks about what someone likes the most. 'Like' is the word that naturally fits this context. 'Hate' is the opposite in meaning, while 'prefer' implies a comparison between two or more items and is less direct for expressing general liking. Thus, 'like' is the best choice.",,,

2,172,What's the price,How much,,"Both 'What's the price' and 'How much' naturally ask for the cost of the shoes. 'How many' would be used to ask about quantity, which is not appropriate in this context. 'What's the price' directly inquires about the cost, and 'How much' is a common way to ask 'How much do these cost?'. Thus, both options are possible answers.",,,
2,173,why,,,,,,
2,174,is,,,,,,
2,175,goes,,,"The option 'goes' is the correct answer because it is the third person singular present form of the verb, which fits the sentence 'He goes to school at seven every day.' The other options 'go' and 'goed' do not correctly convey the habitual action in the present tense.",,,
2,176,is,,,,,,
2,177,are,,,,,,
2,178,finished,,,,,,
2,179,explore,,,"The correct answer is 'explore' because in Korean, '탐험하다' directly means to explore, which best fits the intended meaning of the sentence 'I want to ___ a new city.' The option 'examine' does not convey the intended sense of exploring a new city, and 'visit' implies going there briefly without the sense of in-depth exploration.",,,
2,180,to win competitions,,,,,,
2,181,sent,,,"The sentence is in past tense as indicated by the Korean sentence '보냈어요', which means 'sent'. 'Sent' is the past tense form of 'send', making it the correct answer. 'Send' is present tense, and 'sents' is grammatically incorrect.",,,

2,194,need,want,,"Both 'need' and 'want' can be used naturally in this context when offering assistance. 'Do you need any help?' is commonly used to check if someone requires assistance, while 'Do you want any help?' directly offers help. 'Ask' does not fit grammatically in this sentence.",,,

2,204,scared,afraid,,"Both 'scared' and 'afraid' are acceptable in the sentence 'I'm ____ of spiders.'
 
 1. 'Afraid' naturally fits with the preposition 'of' to express fear, matching the meaning of '무서워' in Korean.
 2. 'Scared' is also commonly used with 'of' in this context and accurately conveys the sense of fear.
 3. 'Concerned' does not fit because it implies worry rather than fear.
 
 Thus, 'scared' and 'afraid' are the correct choices.",,,

2,215,to share,,,,,,
2,216,kind,,,,,,
2,217,to bring,,,,,,
2,218,as fast as,,,"The sentence 'I run as fast as the wind.' is the grammatically correct and natural expression in English which corresponds to the Korean sentence '나는 바람만큼 빠르게 달려요.' 
 
 1. 'as fast as' is the proper simile construction for comparing two things based on speed.
 2. 'fast as' is grammatically incomplete, and 'faster than' implies a comparative that doesn't match the Korean meaning.",,,

2,243,playing,,,,,,
2,244,because,,,"The word 'because' correctly explains the cause-effect relationship expressed in the sentence. The Korean sentence indicates that families gather due to sharing delicious food, making 'because' the natural and logical connector in the English sentence.",,,
2,245,were,,,"The sentence is in the past continuous tense, describing an ongoing action in the past. Since the subject 'they' is plural, 'were' is the grammatically correct auxiliary verb. 'Was' is used for singular subjects and 'are' would indicate a present tense, which does not match the context of the sentence.",,,
2,246,looked,,,,,,
2,247,How fresh,,,"The phrase fits the context since 'fresh' translates to 신선해요 and is commonly used when describing food quality. 'How new' does not reflect the intended meaning, and 'What fresh' is grammatically incorrect in this context.",,,
2,248,smaller,,,"The sentence requires a comparative adjective since it compares the size of the bird and the squirrel. 'Smaller' is the correct comparative form of 'small', fitting grammatically. The other options either do not use the correct comparative form ('more small' is ungrammatical) or do not indicate comparison ('small').",,,

2,251,going,,,,,,
2,252,introduce,,,"The word 'introduce' correctly completes the sentence: 'Let me introduce you to my friend.' It matches the intended meaning of presenting someone to a friend. 'Accompany' would indicate going with someone, and 'invite' would suggest asking someone to come along, which do not fit the context of meeting someone for the first time.",,,

2,255,food,,,,,,
2,256,offer,,,"The phrase 'offer you some tea' is the most idiomatic and natural way to express the intent of asking someone if they would like tea. While 'give' could be used in a more casual context, 'offer' better fits the context of politely offering something to someone. 'Provide' sounds too formal and is not commonly used in this type of casual invitation.",,,

2,260,playing,,,,,,
2,261,go to the park,,,The correct answer is 'go to the park' because the Korean sentence '공원에 갈까?' directly translates to 'Shall we go to the park?'. The other options do not match the context provided.,,,
2,262,wait,,,,,,
2,263,enjoy,,,"The word 'enjoy' fits naturally in the context as it conveys the idea that the speaker takes pleasure in music, which aligns with the Korean hint '나는 음악을 즐겨' meaning 'I enjoy music.' The other options do not match the context: 'tolerate' implies enduring something unpleasant, and 'avoid' means to stay away from, neither of which fit a hobby context.",,,
2,264,become,,,"The word 'become' fits naturally in the sentence 'I'd like to become a doctor,' which aligns with the Korean sentence '난 의사가 되고 싶어.' 'Turn into' is not typically used to describe a professional role change in this context, and 'capture' does not convey the intended meaning at all.",,,

2,270,calls,,,"The sentence requires the third person singular present form of the verb when referring to ""she."" 'Calls' is the correct conjugation for the subject and matches the meaning of the sentence (making a regular phone call each evening). 'Call' is the base form and 'called' is the past form, so neither fits grammatically.",,,

'She' and 'They' do not match the reference as they imply a female individual or plural individuals, respectively.",,,
2,289,Who,,,,,,
2,290,Can,,,,,,
2,291,How,,,,,,
2,292,How,,,"The phrase 'How about some cookies?' is the most natural and idiomatic expression in English for offering something, matching the intent of the Korean sentence '쿠키 좀 어때?'. 'What about' and 'Where about' are not as commonly used in this context, making 'How' the most appropriate choice.",,,

2,296,going,,,,,,
2,297,get,,,"The phrase 'get to the airport' is a common and natural way to ask about transportation methods in English. 'Arrive' would typically be used with the preposition 'at' (i.e., 'arrive at the airport') and 'move' does not fit contextually in this sentence. Therefore, 'get' is the appropriate choice.",,,
2,298,May,,,,,,
2,299,to,,,The phrase 'can't wait to see' is the standard form in English. 'At' and 'on' do not fit grammatically in this context.,,,

2,308,waking,,,"In this sentence, the verb 'dislikes' should be followed by a gerund form, making 'waking' the correct choice. 'Wake' is the base form and 'woken' is the past participle, both of which do not grammatically fit in this context.",,,

2,329,planning to,going to,,"Both 'planning to' and 'going to' can naturally complete the sentence 'What are you ___ do?' in the context of asking about someone's plans, which corresponds to the Korean '뭐 할 계획이니?'.
 
 1. 'Planning to' suggests that the person has intentions or is making arrangements for what they are going to do.
 2. 'Going to' is a common way to talk about future actions or plans.
 3. 'Willing to' does not fit as naturally because it implies readiness or consent rather than a planned action.
 
 Thus, 'planning to' and 'going to' are the correct choices.",,,
2,330,my vacation,,,,,,
2,331,Can,Could,May,"All three options can be used to ask for permission in English, and each fits naturally in the given context.
 
 1. 'Can I borrow your pen?' is common in everyday conversation, though it is less formal.
 2. 'Could I borrow your pen?' is a polite alternative that is widely used when making requests.
 3. 'May I borrow your pen?' is traditionally considered the most formal and appropriate form when asking for permission.
 
 Since the Korean sentence '펜을 빌려도 될까요?' asks for permission, each of these forms is acceptable, making all three possible answers.",,,
2,332,must not,are not allowed to,,"Both 'must not' and 'are not allowed to' indicate a strong prohibition, which is appropriate for the instruction that smoking is forbidden. 'Must not' directly expresses that something is prohibited, while 'are not allowed to' explicitly states that permission is denied. On the other hand, 'should not' is usually used to give advice or a recommendation rather than a strict rule.",,,

2,348,will,,,,,,
2,349,happy,,,"Only 'happy' is an adjective that correctly modifies the noun 'thoughts'. 'Happily' is an adverb and does not fit grammatically in the sentence, and 'happyly' is an incorrect form.",,,
2,350,going to,,,"The phrase 'going to' is appropriate because it fits the structure 'They are going to explore' correctly, indicating a future plan. 'is going to' is incorrect because it does not agree with the plural subject 'They,' and 'go to' does not convey the intended future intent in this context.",,,
2,351,are,,,"The word 'are' is grammatically correct in this sentence because 'letters' is a plural noun and requires the plural form of the verb 'to be'. 'Is' would be used with a singular noun, and 'was' does not match the present tense context of the sentence.",,,
2,352,that,,,"The sentence is stating a belief about a cause-effect relationship where 'that' is used to introduce a subordinate clause explaining the belief. 'If' would incorrectly indicate a condition, and 'because' would be redundant as the sentence already explicitly states the causal connection.",,,
2,353,when friends are nearby,whenever friends are nearby,,"Both 'when friends are nearby' and 'whenever friends are nearby' correctly convey the idea that Soo feels happy in the context of having friends nearby, which aligns with the Korean sentence meaning '수는 친구들이 가까이 있을 때 행복해요.'
 
 1. 'When friends are nearby' fits naturally as a general temporal indicator.
 2. 'Whenever friends are nearby' also works since it emphasizes repeatedly occurring instances when this condition is met.
 3. 'If friends are nearby' is less suitable because it implies a conditional possibility rather than describing a general state, making it less aligned with the intended meaning.",,,
2,354,looks,,,,,,
2,355,Nice to meet you,Great to meet you,,"Both 'Nice to meet you' and 'Great to meet you' are common greetings used during first-time introductions, matching the friendly tone of the Korean sentence '정말 반가워'. 'Nice to meet you' is a standard greeting, and 'Great to meet you' also conveys enthusiasm, making them both appropriate choices. 'Good to see you', however, is typically used when meeting someone already known, so it is less suitable in this context.",,,
2,356,love,,,,,,
2,357,What's the matter?,,,Since the Korean sentence translates to '무슨 문제야?' which literally asks 'What's the matter?' the phrase 'What's the matter?' (option_2) best fits. The other options ('What's happening?' and 'How's it going?') have different meanings and do not align with the intended question.,,,
2,358,might want to,should,,"Both 'might want to' and 'should' work well in the sentence 'You _____ get some advice' when translating from the Korean sentence '너는 조언을 받는 것이 좋겠어,' which suggests that receiving advice is a good idea. 'Should' directly expresses advisability or a recommendation, while 'might want to' also implies that it would be a good idea without being as forceful. 'Must' is too strong and implies obligation rather than a suggestion, so it does not match the tone of the Korean sentence.",,,
2,359,read,,,,,,
2,360,becoming,being,,"Both 'becoming' and 'being' are gerunds that correctly follow the phrase 'dream of', making them grammatically acceptable choices in this context. 'Becoming a doctor' emphasizes the process of achieving the status, while 'being a doctor' highlights the state of holding the position. 'Become' is not suitable because it does not follow the required gerund form after 'dream of'.",,,
2,361,May I,Can I,,"Both 'May I' and 'Can I' can be used in this context to politely ask for permission to do something. 'May I' is traditionally correct for asking permission, while 'Can I' is also commonly used in everyday speech and understood as a request for permission. 'Should I' does not fit the context as it implies asking if one ought to do something rather than seeking permission.",,,
2,362,help,,,"The word 'help' is the most natural and idiomatic choice in this context. In the sentence 'Would you mind ___ me?,' the form expected is a gerund, as in 'helping me.' Although 'support' and 'assist' can work in other contexts, the phrase 'help me' is far more common in everyday conversation when asking for assistance, making 'help' the most appropriate selection.",,,
2,363,planning to,,,The phrase 'planning to' is the best fit for the question 'What are you ______ do after class?' because it accurately reflects the intended meaning of having a plan for what to do after class. 'Willing to' and 'about to' do not convey the sense of planning conveyed in the Korean sentence.,,,
2,364,wonderful,,,,,,
2,365,want to,would like to,,"Both 'want to' and 'would like to' accurately express the desire to eat, which aligns with the Korean sentence asking what one wants to eat. 'Plan to' implies a premeditated decision or planning, which does not match the expressed desire in the Korean version.",,,

2,387,Nice to meet you,,,,,,
2,388,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' are acceptable in this context. The basic, common expression is 'Do you like ice cream?', and 'enjoy' directly matches the Korean verb '즐기다'. 'Love' implies a stronger emotion than is typically intended in a general inquiry about one's fondness for ice cream.",,,
2,389,am,,,,,,
2,390,Look,,,"The phrase 'Look out!' is a common way of warning someone to be cautious, which directly translates to the Korean '조심해! 조심해!'. Although 'Watch out!' is also correct as a warning phrase, using it twice (as provided by the quiz) would be redundant in this context. 'Care out!' does not form a natural or common expression in English. Thus, 'Look' is the best choice.",,,
2,391,How was,How did,,"Both 'How was' and 'How did' can be correctly used in this context. 'How was your trip?' is a straightforward way to ask about the experience by referring to the trip in the past, which matches the answer 'It was really enjoyable.' Similarly, 'How did you like your trip?' is also a common construction to ask for someone's opinion on their experience, and the response fits well with this formulation. 'How do' is less appropriate here because it implies asking about an ongoing experience. Thus, the possible answers are 'How was' and 'How did'.",,,

2,403,is,,,,,,
2,404,suggest,,,,,,
2,405,celebrated,,,,,,
2,406,Cooking,,,"The gerund 'Cooking' is appropriate because it functions as the subject of the sentence, referring to the act of preparing meals. 'Cooked' is an adjective describing the state of meals and does not denote the action, while 'Cook' in its base form does not grammatically fit as a subject in this context.",,,
2,407,to grow stronger,,,,,,
2,408,sings,,,,,,
2,409,more interesting,,,"The sentence compares two things, the museum and the park. 'More interesting' correctly forms the comparative, whereas 'most interesting' is a superlative usually used when comparing three or more items, and 'interesting' is the base form which does not express a comparison.",,,
2,410,give,,,,,,
2,411,play,,,,,,
2,412,is listening,,,,,,
2,413,will,,,,,,
2,414,are,,,"The sentence refers to multiple ideas circulating in the town, which requires a plural verb. 'Are' is the correct choice because it agrees with the plural subject 'ideas'. 'Is' and 'was' do not fit grammatically.",,,
2,415,myself,,,,,,
2,416,should,,,,,,
2,417,most delicious,,,The correct choice is 'most delicious' because the sentence context indicates the superlative form (가장 맛있는) is needed. 'More delicious' is a comparative form and 'deliciousest' is not a standard word.,,,

2,419,name,,,,,,

2,422,swim,,,,,,
2,423,May I,Can I,,"Both 'May I' and 'Can I' are commonly used to request permission, especially in informal contexts. 'May I' is traditionally correct for asking permission and aligns well with the polite tone of the Korean sentence, while 'Can I' is also frequently used in everyday speech to achieve the same meaning. 'Should I' does not fit because it implies seeking advice on whether it is appropriate to borrow the pencil, rather than asking for permission.",,,
2,424,Avoid,,,"The sentence 'Avoid touching that' correctly conveys the imperative to not touch the object, which aligns with the Korean instruction '그것을 만지지 마세요'. The other options, 'Permit' and 'Ignore', do not convey the requisite prohibition.",,,
2,425,helping,,,,,,
2,426,appreciate,,,,,,
2,427,How about,What about,,"Both 'How about' and 'What about' can be used to ask for someone's opinion, which fits the meaning of the Korean sentence '이것에 대해 어떻게 생각해?'. 'Why not' does not match the context as it is typically used to offer a suggestion rather than ask for an opinion.",,,
2,428,planning to,,,,,,
2,429,sad,,,,,,
2,430,wonderful,,,,,,
2,431,travel,,,,,,
2,432,good,great,,"Both 'good' and 'great' naturally fit the sentence, conveying approval of the idea. 'Good idea' is a common, universally accepted expression, while 'great idea' conveys an even stronger impression. Although 'nice idea' is grammatically correct, it is less typically used in this context.",,,

2,436,is playing,,,,,,
2,437,walked,,,"In this sentence, the simple past 'walked' is needed to properly sequence the events in the past. 'Walking' would be a present participle or gerund form, and 'walk' does not correctly match the past narrative of the sentence.",,,

2,441,that,,,,,,
2,442,himself,,,,,,
2,443,walks,,,"The correct answer is 'walks' because the sentence uses the third-person singular subject 'she', which requires the verb to be conjugated in the simple present tense with an '-s' ending. 'Walks' fits grammatically, while 'walk' and 'walking' do not.",,,

2,449,pleasant,amazing,,"Both 'pleasant' and 'amazing' appropriately complete the sentence and convey a positive sentiment about the walk as reflected in the Korean sentence '정말 즐거운 산책이었어요!'.
 
 1. 'Pleasant' fits naturally in the sentence and describes a walk that was enjoyable.
 2. 'Amazing' also works well, highlighting that the walk was exceptionally enjoyable, even though the article 'an' would normally be used with words starting with a vowel sound, the intended meaning remains clear.
 
 Thus, both 'pleasant' and 'amazing' are acceptable choices.",,,
2,450,to find inspiration,,,,,,
2,451,I’m,,,"The sentence 'Hello, ___ Lily. Pleased to meet you.' is a self-introduction, where the speaker is saying 'I’m Lily.' The option 'I’m' correctly completes the introduction. 'That’s' and 'Here’s' do not fit the context of self-identification.",,,

2,454,doing,,,,,,
2,455,Can,Would,,"Both 'Can' and 'Would' are commonly used for making a request in English. 'Can you give me a ride home?' is a direct request asking about the ability to provide a ride, while 'Would you give me a ride home?' is a polite form that implies willingness. 'Should' does not fit naturally in this context as it implies obligation rather than a request.",,,

2,458,wait,,,,,,
2,459,don’t,,,"The expression 'why don't you try' is a common suggestion in English, making 'don’t' the most appropriate choice. 'Won't' and 'didn't' do not fit grammatically or semantically in this context.",,,

2,478,most,,,"The superlative 'most' correctly corresponds to the Korean phrase '가장', meaning 'the most' in English. 'More' is a comparative form and 'very' is an intensifier, neither of which properly forms a superlative construction in this context.",,,

2,481,You should,,,,,,
2,482,suggest,,,"The Korean text '나는 이 요리를 제안해요.' directly translates to 'I suggest this dish.' Although 'recommend' might be commonly used in restaurant contexts, the given Korean word corresponds most accurately to 'suggest'. The option 'try' does not fit the intended meaning, making 'suggest' the only appropriate answer.",,,

2,489,going to,planning,,"Both 'going to' and 'planning' correctly complete the sentence in a natural way. 'Going to' fits because it directly expresses a future intention, which aligns with the provided response 'I’m going to visit the museum.' 'Planning' also fits as it implies having made prior arrangements or intentions regarding the trip. 'Thinking of' is less appropriate since it does not naturally combine with 'to do' in this context.",,,

2,493,Cooking new recipes,,,"The sentence requires a gerund phrase to function as the subject. Option 1, 'Cooking new recipes', correctly uses the gerund form 'cooking' and the plural 'recipes', matching the intended meaning of the Korean sentence and providing a grammatically correct structure.",,,
2,494,who,,,,,,
2,495,have,,,,,,
2,496,are,were,,"Both 'are' and 'were' can be considered acceptable answers depending on the context of the sentence. 
 
 1. 'Are donated' uses the present simple in the passive voice, matching the Korean translation '기부되요' which is in the present tense, suggesting a general or habitual action.
 2. 'Were donated' correctly uses the past simple in the passive voice, which would imply that the donation happened as a completed action in the past. The sentence structure accommodates a past event as well.
 3. 'Is donated' is grammatically incorrect because 'clothes' is plural, so it is eliminated.
 
 Thus, 'are' and 'were' are both acceptable answers, with 'are' being more aligned with the present tense interpretation, and 'were' valid in the context of past action.",,,
2,497,that,,,"The word 'that' is the correct relative pronoun to refer to the meal (a thing) shared. 'When' is incorrect because it is used to refer to time, and 'who' is used for people.",,,

2,499,embrace digital learning,to embrace digital learning,,"Both 'embrace digital learning' and 'to embrace digital learning' are acceptable in this sentence.
 
 1. 'embrace digital learning' uses the subjunctive mood, which is a correct and common construction after verbs such as 'urge'.
 2. 'to embrace digital learning' follows the more explicit pattern 'urge someone to do something', which is also grammatically correct.
 
 The third option, 'for embrace digital learning', is not grammatically sound.",,,
2,500,appear,,,"The word 'appear' is chosen because it fits the context of the sentence, implying that the sketches look smoother when fine pencils are used. The other options, 'jump' and 'boil', do not fit the intended meaning of showing a changed visual appearance.",,,
2,501,usually,,,,,,
2,502,so excited,,,"The phrase 'so excited' is the most natural choice because it naturally pairs with the 'that' clause to indicate a degree of excitement causing his reaction. 'Too excited' typically suggests an excessive state that might have a negative implication, and 'very excited' does not clearly connect the cause and effect as indicated by the clause 'that he jumped with joy.'",,,
2,503,much,really,,"Both 'much' and 'really' are acceptable intensifiers that can be used with the adjective 'larger' to indicate a significant difference. 'Much larger' is a standard comparative expression, while 'really larger' is an informal alternative that also conveys the idea of a notable size difference. 'So' is less common in this context, as it typically requires an accompanying result clause (e.g., 'so large that...').",,,
2,504,relieved,,,,,,
2,505,where the local market was,,,"Option 1 is the correct answer because it fits the pattern of reported speech. When transforming a direct question to indirect speech, the word order becomes subject + verb. 
 1. 'where the local market was' correctly places the subject 'the local market' before the verb 'was'. 
 2. 'where was the local market' is the original order from a direct question and should not be used in reported speech. 
 3. 'where local market was' is grammatically incorrect because it is missing the article 'the' before 'local market'.",,,

2,518,open the window,,,The Korean sentence asks if it's okay to open the window (창문을 열다) and only 'open the window' corresponds to that meaning. The other options do not match the context provided.,,,
2,519,really interesting,,,,,,
2,520,would,could,,"Both 'would' and 'could' are acceptable in this context because the speaker is expressing a prediction that something will be challenging.
 
 1. 'Would' is often used to talk about hypothetical situations or predictions, which fits well with '정말 힘들 것 같아요,' implying that the situation is expected to be challenging.
 2. 'Could' is used to express possibility, and in this sentence, it also suggests that there is a possibility of encountering challenges, which aligns with the meaning of the Korean sentence.
 3. 'Should' is less fitting because it implies necessity or obligation, which does not match the intended meaning of a prediction or possibility.
 
 Thus, both 'would' and 'could' are valid choices.",,,
2,521,must not,,,"The Korean sentence expresses prohibition (should not do something). 'Must not' directly communicates that something is forbidden, which is the intended meaning. 'Cannot' implies inability rather than prohibition, and 'should' is not appropriately negative in this context.",,,
2,522,loud noises,,,,,,
2,523,Which,What,,"Both 'Which' and 'What' are grammatically correct in this sentence and can be used to translate the Korean word '어떤,' which expresses a choice among several options. 'Which' implies a specific set of known snacks, while 'What' can be used more generally to ask for an identification of the snack chosen. 'Where' is incorrect because it indicates a location rather than a choice of item.",,,

2,532,not only remarkable crafts but also unique decorations,,,"Option 1 is the most suitable because it maintains the correlative conjunction structure 'not only ... but also', which is required to accurately reflect the meaning in the Korean sentence. The sentence emphasizes that he designs both remarkable crafts and unique decorations, and option 1 correctly captures this dual element.",,,
2,533,enough,,,,,,
2,534,so that,,,,,,
2,535,avoid sugary drinks,,,"The phrase 'had better' is followed by the base form of the verb, which makes 'avoid sugary drinks' the correct option. 'Avoids sugary drinks' is third-person singular and 'avoiding sugary drinks' is the gerund form, neither of which fit grammatically after 'had better'.",,,
2,536,do,,,,,,
2,537,must,,,,,,
2,538,few,,,"The adjective 'few' is the best fit because it implies that there were almost no signs present, aligning with the Korean expression '거의 없었어요'. On the other hand, 'a few' or 'an few' would imply a small, noticeable number, which does not match the intended meaning of the sentence.",,,
2,539,read,,,,,,
2,540,style,type,,"Both 'style' and 'type' can be used to refer to the kind or category of music. In the given sentence, the Korean term '종류' translates more directly to 'type', but 'style' is also often used to describe musical genres. 'Model' does not fit the context at all, so it is excluded.",,,

2,548,Remember to,,,"The phrase 'Remember to' fits the context of the instruction to ensure that the lights are turned off before leaving, matching the reminder tone of the Korean sentence. 'Skip to' doesn't make sense in this context, and 'Forget to' would mean the opposite of what is intended.",,,
2,549,planning to,going to,,"Both 'planning to' and 'going to' naturally express a scheduled or intended action in the near future, which fits with the context of visiting grandparents this weekend. 'Planning to' indicates that the action is being arranged, while 'going to' is commonly used to express a future plan. 'Thinking of' conveys a less definitive intention, making it less appropriate in this context.",,,

2,559,that,,,"The sentence requires a relative pronoun that refers to the doctor as the subject of the clause 'advises healthy eating.' 'That' functions as a subject relative pronoun and fits naturally here. 'Whom' is used for objects, not subjects, and 'where' is used for locations, making them both unsuitable.",,,
2,560,jogging,,,"The sentence requires the present participle form to indicate an ongoing action observed by Sam in the park. 'Jogging' fits this requirement, while 'jog' is the base form and 'jogged' is past tense, making them less appropriate.",,,

2,570,because of,,,"The phrase 'because of' is the correct choice as it properly functions as a preposition to explain the reason behind improving her skills. 'Because' is a conjunction and would require a clause to follow, and 'cause of' is not a grammatically standard form in this context.",,,
2,571,improving my English,,,"The sentence is asking for advice specifically for improving English skills, as indicated by the Korean translation. 'Improving my English' directly corresponds to enhancing English abilities, whereas 'learning French' and 'studying math' do not match the intended focus of the advice.",,,

2,580,take,,,,,,
2,581,familiar,,,"Within the sentence, the phrase 'familiar with' is commonly used to indicate that someone is accustomed to or comfortable with something. 'Familiar' fits well with the idea of being used to a schedule. In contrast, 'confused' suggests a lack of understanding or disorder, and 'refreshed' does not logically fit the context. Thus, 'familiar' is the correct choice.",,,

2,586,I think,I guess,,"Both 'I think' and 'I guess' are commonly used to express a personal prediction or assumption about future events, and they fit naturally into the sentence 'I ___ it's going to be windy today.'
 
 1. 'I think' is often used to express an opinion or belief about something that may happen, which matches the context of a weather prediction.
 2. 'I guess' similarly indicates a tentative prediction and is frequently used in informal contexts.
 3. 'I assume' tends to suggest a conclusion based on logic or evidence, which is less natural for a simple weather forecast, making it a less suitable choice in this context.",,,

2,591,interesting,,,,,,
2,592,three times,,,,,,
2,593,so thrilling,,,"The phrase 'so thrilling' fits perfectly as it completes the sentence with the causal structure 'so... that'. It implies that the game was extremely exciting, which resulted in playing it for hours. 'Very thrilling' doesn't establish a cause-and-effect relationship, and 'too thrilling' typically implies an excessive quality that might have a negative connotation or require a different sentence structure.",,,
2,594,peculiar,,,,,,
2,595,listen,,,,,,
2,596,asked,,,"The word 'asked' is the correct choice because it fits both the grammatical structure of the sentence and the intended meaning in the Korean translation. The sentence indicates that he requested the teacher to explain the assignment, and 'asked' is the appropriate past tense form for this context.",,,
2,597,If,When,,"Both 'If' and 'When' work in this sentence to express a conditional relationship between practicing every day and progress following.
 
 1. 'If' is the most common conditional term used to indicate that progress will follow provided that you practice every day.
 2. 'When' also fits because it implies that whenever you practice daily, progress will follow, which is applicable in a habitual or general truth sense.
 3. 'Unless' does not work because it introduces a negative condition that contradicts the intended meaning of the sentence.",,,
2,598,steepest,,,,,,
2,599,hear,,,"The sentence indicates that the wind is producing a sound ('whispering through the trees'), so 'hear' is the correct choice. 'See' and 'touch' do not appropriately match the context of listening to the wind.",,,
2,600,Although,,,,,,
2,601,which,,,,,,
2,602,what time,when,,"Both 'what time' and 'when' are acceptable in this sentence.
 
 1. 'What time' directly asks for the specific time at which the train arrived, matching the query '기차가 몇 시에 도착했는지'.
 2. 'When' can also be used as an embedded question marker to refer to the time of arrival, making it grammatically correct and natural in this context.
 3. 'How long' is inappropriate because it asks about duration rather than the specific time of arrival.",,,
2,603,fascinated,,,,,,
2,604,swim,,,,,,
2,605,the trip,,,,,,
2,606,Remember,,,"The word 'Remember' fits naturally into the sentence 'Remember to finish your assignment,' which corresponds to the Korean phrase '과제를 끝내는 것을 기억해.' 'Promise' does not fit because it would imply making a promise rather than a reminder, and 'Forget' would convey the opposite meaning of what is intended.",,,
2,607,know,hear,,"Both 'know' and 'hear' work in this context.
 
 1. 'Know' is the direct translation of '알고 있나요' and fits naturally with the intended meaning of being informed about the new movie.
 2. 'Hear' is used idiomatically in English (as in 'hear about') to ask if someone has received information or news regarding something, making it a viable alternative option.
 3. 'See' does not work appropriately in this sentence as it does not convey the sense of being informed or aware.
 
 Thus, both 'know' and 'hear' are acceptable choices.",,,
2,608,Come,,,"The phrase 'Come again?' is a common idiom used when someone did not understand or didn’t hear what was said, and it fits the context of the sentence. 'Stop again?' and 'Go again?' do not carry that idiomatic meaning.",,,
2,609,do,,,,,,
2,610,give,,,,,,
2,611,wrong,,,"In this context, when someone says 'I feel sick,' it's natural to ask 'What's wrong?' to inquire about the person's condition. 'What's up?' is more of a general greeting and does not specifically concern a person's well-being, while 'happen' doesn't fit grammatically.",,,
2,612,review your notes,,,The Korean sentence translates directly to 'Why don't you review your notes?' indicating that reviewing notes is the intended action. The options 'go for a walk' and 'watch TV' do not match the context of reviewing notes for study purposes.,,,
2,613,space exploration,,,,,,
2,614,same,,,,,,
2,615,music,,,"The Korean sentence explicitly asks about the type of music someone likes, and only 'music' from the available options matches that context.",,,
2,616,coffee,,,,,,
2,617,feel,,,"The Korean sentence uses '어떻게 느끼니?', which directly translates to 'How do you feel about this movie?'. Although both 'think' and 'feel' could be commonly used in movie-related questions in English, the specific Korean phrasing emphasizes emotion ('feel'), making 'feel' the most appropriate choice. 'Hear' is unrelated in this context.",,,

2,621,is,,,,,,
2,622,who,,,,,,
2,623,has overcome,overcame,,"Both 'has overcome' and 'overcame' can be used correctly in this sentence depending on the context. 'Has overcome' (present perfect) implies that her overcoming challenges has relevance to the present, while 'overcame' (simple past) directly states a completed action in the past, which matches the Korean sentence's past action style. 'Have overcome' is grammatically incorrect because it does not agree with the singular subject 'she'.",,,
2,624,important,,,,,,
2,625,explore,,,,,,
2,626,so slippery,,,"The phrase 'so slippery' is correct because it fits the common 'so ... that' construction: 'The road was so slippery that we had to drive slowly.' The other options are incorrect: 'so slipperyly' is an adverb, which is not appropriate here, and 'too slippery' typically needs a different construction (e.g., 'too slippery to drive fast') and does not work well with 'that we had to drive slowly.'",,,

2,629,to draw,,,,,,
2,630,noticed,,,,,,
2,631,that inspires calm,,,,,,
2,632,beautiful,,,"The structure 'as ___ as' requires the base form of an adjective. 'Beautiful' fits naturally in the sentence to describe the quality of friendship by comparison to the beauty of a sunset. 'More beautiful' and 'most beautiful' are comparative and superlative forms respectively, which do not fit grammatically in this expression.",,,
2,633,where the gallery is located,,,,,,
2,634,roasted,,,,,,
2,635,planning,going,,"Both 'planning' and 'going' can grammatically and semantically complete the sentence. 'What are you planning to do?' and 'What are you going to do?' are common ways to ask about someone's future intentions, and B's response 'I’m going to complete my homework' fits naturally with either option. 'About' would form the question 'What are you about to do?', which typically implies something imminent rather than a planned future activity, making it a less appropriate fit in this context.",,,
2,636,compare,,,,,,
2,637,serve,offer,,"Both 'serve' and 'offer' work naturally in the sentence. 'Offer' is commonly used when asking if someone would like to have a piece of cake, and 'serve' is also appropriate when presenting food to someone. 'Give' is less appropriate as it lacks the nuance of providing or presenting food in a polite context.",,,
2,638,explain,,,"The word 'explain' fits most naturally in the sentence 'Could you explain what you mean by 'sustainable living'?' This phrasing is standard for asking someone to clarify or elaborate on their meaning. Although 'describe' might also occasionally be used, 'explain' is generally the more common and appropriate choice in this context. 'Discuss' does not fit well, as it implies a longer conversation rather than a clarification.",,,
2,639,matter,,,"The phrase 'What's the matter?' is a common English expression used to inquire about someone's condition or problem, especially in reference to a physical issue. While 'issue' and 'trouble' might seem plausible, 'matter' is the idiomatically correct choice in this context.",,,
2,640,meet,,,,,,
2,641,use,,,,,,
2,642,mustn't,can't,,"Both 'mustn't' and 'can't' are appropriate in this context because they are used to express prohibition. 'Mustn't' directly indicates that something is not allowed, which fits perfectly with the Korean sentence meaning '아니, 그렇게 하면 안 돼.' Similarly, 'can't' also expresses that something is not permitted. The option 'must' does not convey prohibition in this case, so it is not included.",,,
2,643,I hope you succeed,,,"The Korean sentence '네가 성공하길 바래' translates to 'I hope you succeed.' Option 1 directly corresponds to this meaning. Options 2 and 3 (I hope you enjoy / I hope you can rest) do not match the Korean expression, making them unsuitable.",,,
2,644,describe,,,,,,
2,645,I want to complain about,,,,,,
2,646,Don't forget to,Remember to,,"Both 'Don't forget to' and 'Remember to' naturally remind someone to submit their homework, which fits the Korean instruction to remember to submit the homework.
 
 1. 'Don't forget to' is a common reminder phrase to ensure that the task (submitting homework) is not omitted.
 2. 'Remember to' serves the same function by prompting the listener to keep the task in mind.
 3. 'Make sure you' implies an obligation or instruction to guarantee the action is completed and is slightly different in nuance than a simple reminder, making it less appropriate in this context.",,,
2,647,experienced,,,,,,
2,648,bake a cake,,,"The Korean sentence specifically asks if you can explain how to bake a cake (케이크를 굽는 방법을 설명할 수 있니?). 'Bake a cake' directly matches this meaning, while the other options ('cook dinner' and 'make a sandwich') do not relate to baking a cake.",,,
2,649,biodiversity,,,,,,
2,650,fantastic,incredible,,"Both 'fantastic' and 'incredible' fit naturally in the exclamatory sentence and effectively convey the sense of amazement and disbelief expressed in the Korean translation '믿을 수 없을 정도로 놀라워!'. 'Fantastic' is commonly used to express something as remarkably good or excellent, while 'incredible' directly communicates the feeling of something being hard to believe due to its extraordinary nature. 'Tremendous', although it can express greatness, is less commonly used in a casual exclamatory context to convey this level of personal astonishment.",,,
2,651,who,,,,,,
2,652,whom I admire,who I admire,,"Both 'whom I admire' and 'who I admire' can be acceptable in this sentence. 'Whom I admire' is traditionally correct because the pronoun is used as the object of 'admire'. However, in modern informal usage, many native speakers use 'who' even when it functions as an object. The option 'which I admire' is unsuitable because it is used for non-human entities. Therefore, both 'whom I admire' and 'who I admire' are acceptable choices.",,,
2,653,fun,,,,,,
2,654,was built,,,"The sentence requires a past passive construction to match the Korean sentence indicating a completed action. 'Was built' is the correct past passive form. 'Built' is incorrect due to the lack of an auxiliary verb, and 'is built' is present passive, which does not match the context.",,,
2,655,wants,,,,,,
2,656,made,,,,,,
2,657,has visited,,,,,,
2,658,largest,,,"The correct superlative form for adjectives with more than one syllable in this context is 'largest'. 'More large' is not a common or grammatically correct form, and 'larger' is a comparative, not a superlative, making 'largest' the only appropriate choice given the context of the sentence.",,,

2,667,interesting,,,,,,
2,668,excited,,,,,,
2,669,thinking,,,"The sentence 'I’m thinking about learning French.' is the most natural because the original Korean sentence implies that the speaker is 'thinking' about learning French. The phrase 'thinking about' directly matches the intended meaning. 'Going' doesn’t fit grammatically, and 'planning' would imply a more definitive arrangement than simply considering it.",,,
2,670,free at,available at,,"Both 'free at' and 'available at' naturally inquire about someone's schedule or time at 3 p.m., matching the Korean sentence asking if the person has time at that moment. 'Free' and 'available' are commonly used to ask if someone is unoccupied, whereas 'ready' does not appropriately ask about having available time.",,,
2,671,K-pop,,,"The Korean version of the question directly mentions K-pop, making it the only option that aligns with the context. The other options (Hip-hop and Classical) do not match the reference in the Korean sentence.",,,
2,672,stay up,,,,,,
2,673,recall,,,"The sentence asks, 'Can you ___?', corresponding to 'Do you remember?' in Korean. 'Recall' means 'to remember' which matches the meaning of the question. 'Forget' and 'omit' do not appropriately convey the intended meaning.",,,
2,674,think,,,"The phrase 'Let me think' is a common expression used to indicate that someone needs a moment to consider something, which aligns with the Korean sentence '잠깐만요, 잠시 생각해 볼게요.' The other options do not match this context as well.",,,
2,675,play the piano,,,,,,
2,676,To start,,,,,,
2,677,explain,,,,,,
2,678,expect,,,"The sentence 'I didn’t expect that!' is the common expression that conveys surprise because something was not anticipated. Although 'predict' could technically be used, it is less natural in informal spoken language compared to 'expect'. The option 'overlook' does not fit the context of being surprised by an unexpected event.",,,
2,679,enjoy,,,,,,
2,680,Well done!,Good job!,,"Both 'Well done!' and 'Good job!' accurately convey the congratulatory meaning of '잘했어!' in Korean. 'Well done!' and 'Good job!' are common expressions of praise for accomplishments, while 'That's amazing!' is more about expressing astonishment or surprise and does not match the intended meaning.",,,
2,681,dissatisfied,,,"The Korean sentence indicates having a complaint about the service, and 'dissatisfied' best reflects that sentiment. 'Satisfied' means content, and 'curious' is unrelated to the expressed dissatisfaction.",,,
2,682,I’m planning to,I intend to,,"Both 'I’m planning to' and 'I intend to' appropriately express a clear intention to travel abroad next year, which aligns with the Korean phrase '나는 내년에 해외여행을 가려고 해.' This phrase indicates a decided plan or intention rather than a mere thought, making these two options the best fits. 'I’m thinking of' suggests a less committed idea, which does not fully capture the intended meaning.",,,
2,683,to finish,,,,,,
2,684,when,,,"The word 'when' is the natural choice because the sentence in Korean indicates a conditional scenario that occurs upon visiting the park. 'When' correctly conveys that he relaxes as part of his visit, making it the best fit compared to 'if' or 'unless'.",,,

2,695,safer,,,,,,
2,696,were installed,,,,,,
2,697,to explore,,,"In the sentence 'It is important ___ cultural traditions', the infinitive form 'to explore' correctly completes the sentence by indicating the purpose or need to examine cultural traditions. The other options 'explore' and 'explored' do not fit grammatically in this context.",,,
2,698,lets,,,"The correct option is 'lets' because 'mentor' is singular and needs the third person singular form of 'let' (which is 'lets') in the sentence. 'Let' without the 's' does not agree with a singular subject, and 'letted' is grammatically incorrect. Therefore, 'lets' is the appropriate choice.",,,

2,707,Head,Walk,,"Both 'Head' and 'Walk' could appropriately fill the blank in this sentence.
 
 1. 'Head' is commonly used to indicate direction when giving verbal directions (e.g., 'head for two blocks') without specifying the mode of travel, which works well in this context.
 2. 'Walk' is also suitable because the instruction implies moving along a certain distance (two blocks), which is typical for walking.
 3. 'Drive' is less fitting because 'blocks' are usually associated with pedestrian directions rather than vehicular ones.
 
 Thus, both 'Head' and 'Walk' are acceptable answers.",,,
2,708,prefer,,,,,,
2,709,know,,,,,,
2,710,I’ve been told,I heard,,"Both 'I’ve been told' and 'I heard' fit naturally in the sentence given in the quiz. The Korean sentence indicates that someone communicated to the speaker that she moved to New York. 'I heard' is commonly used to refer to receiving information indirectly, while 'I’ve been told' implies that someone informed the speaker. 'I saw' does not work here because it suggests direct observation rather than receiving information verbally.",,,
2,711,sleep,,,,,,
2,712,critical thinking,,,,,,
2,713,that,this,,"Both 'that' and 'this' can be used to refer to something unexpected in this context.
 
 1. 'That' is commonly used when referring to something which has been mentioned before or is understood in context, and works well in exclamatory statements like this.
 2. 'This' can also be used to refer to the current situation or the immediate event, making it a natural choice in conversation.
 3. 'Everything' does not fit as naturally in this context because it implies a broader scope than what the sentence is suggesting.",,,
2,714,opening the window,,,,,,
2,715,to celebrate,,,"The phrase 'a reason to celebrate' is a common and grammatically correct expression. 'Celebrating' does not fit naturally after 'reason' in this construction, and 'for celebrate' is not a grammatically valid form.",,,
2,716,avoid,,,The correct answer is 'avoid' because the phrase 'learned how to avoid accidents' is grammatically correct and commonly used in English. 'Avoiding' and 'avoided' do not fit grammatically in this construction.,,,

2,729,whom,who,,"Both 'whom' and 'who' could be considered correct in this sentence.
 
 1. 'Whom' is technically the correct object form for a person. In the relative clause 'everyone loves', the blank refers to the object of the verb 'loves', making 'whom' grammatically appropriate.
 
 2. 'Who' is also widely accepted in modern informal and even formal usage, and many native speakers use it as a relative pronoun regardless of its traditional case function.
 
 'Which' is not appropriate because it is used for things, not for a person like a singer.",,,

2,739,prefer,,,"The Korean sentence asks which one you favor (선호하니), and the response 'I prefer tea to coffee' directly reflects a choice based on preference. Although 'like' and 'enjoy' are grammatically possible in other contexts, 'prefer' best aligns with the intended meaning of selecting one option over the other.",,,
2,740,excited about,looking forward to,,"Both 'excited about' and 'looking forward to' naturally convey the anticipation and positive expectation indicated in the Korean sentence (나는 주말을 정말 기대하고 있어). 'Excited about' implies a feeling of enthusiasm, and 'looking forward to' explicitly states the act of anticipating something. 'Waiting for' is less suitable as it generally implies a more passive expectation without the emotional nuance present in the original sentence.",,,
2,741,experienced,,,,,,
2,742,happy,,,,,,
2,743,Sounds,,,,,,
2,744,Will you,Can you,,"Both 'Will you' and 'Can you' can be used in this context. 'Will you' is used to ask for willingness to fix the meeting time, while 'Can you' inquires about the ability to do so. Given that the Korean sentence is asking if someone can adjust the meeting time, both expressions are acceptable since they serve as polite requests.",,,
2,745,heard,,,,,,
2,746,mean,,,,,,
2,747,make,,,,,,
2,748,Remember,,,"The sentence translates to 'Remember to call me later,' which is a direct match with the Korean hint '나중에 전화하는 거 기억해.' 'Be sure' would imply making certain that one calls, but it does not directly capture the meaning of '기억해' (remember). 'Forget' has the opposite meaning. Therefore, 'Remember' is the best choice.",,,

2,752,learned,,,,,,
2,753,doesn't it,,,"The tag question needs to agree in number with the subject 'the team', which is singular in this context. 'Doesn't it' is grammatically correct because it uses the singular auxiliary 'does'. The other options are incorrect: 'don't it' uses the plural auxiliary incorrectly, and 'didn't it' uses the past tense which does not match the present tense of the sentence.",,,

2,758,to remember important lessons,,,,,,
2,759,makes,,,"The word 'makes' is the correct answer because 'screen' is a singular noun, and the verb must agree with it. 'Make' would be used for plural subjects, and 'made' is in the past tense, which doesn't fit the present-tense context of the sentence.",,,

2,767,good,skilled,,"Both 'good' and 'skilled' are acceptable in the sentence 'I'm ___ at playing the piano.'
 
 1. 'Good' is a commonly used adjective to express proficiency, matching the Korean sentence '나는 피아노를 연주하는 것을 잘해.'
 2. 'Skilled' also fits as it directly translates to being proficient or having skill, which is appropriate for playing the piano.
 3. 'Fantastic' is less common in this context as it is typically used to express extreme enthusiasm rather than a general ability.",,,
2,768,sure,,,,,,
2,769,What,,,The blank should be filled with 'What' because 'What kind of music do you like?' is a common question asking about preferences in music. 'Where' or 'Why' do not fit grammatically or semantically in the sentence.,,,
2,770,find,,,The word 'find' fits naturally in the sentence 'Where can I find a good café?' because it matches the inquiry about locating a café. 'Order' and 'rent' do not make sense in this context.,,,
2,771,Have,,,,,,
2,772,What,,,"The correct expression is ""What's the weather like today?"" where 'What' is contracted to ""What's"". 'How' would lead to an ungrammatical expression ""How's the weather like today?"" and 'When' is not appropriate for asking about characteristics of the weather.",,,

2,782,How,,,,,,
2,783,that,who,,"Both 'that' and 'who' are acceptable relative pronouns when referring to people. 'Who' is directly used for persons, which makes it a natural choice. 'That' is also commonly accepted in informal and even formal English when referring to people, so both options are correct. 'Whom' is incorrect in this context because it would need to be used as an object, not the subject, of the clause.",,,
2,784,When,After,,"Both 'When' and 'After' can logically complete the sentence. 'After' explicitly indicates that the late-night snack occurred following the conclusion of the concert, as directly described in the Korean sentence. 'When' also connects the events consequentially, indicating that the snack occurred at the time the concert ended. 'While' would imply simultaneity, which does not fit the context.",,,
2,785,has,,,"Only 'has' is correct because the subject 'He' requires the third person singular form. 'Has worked' correctly forms the present perfect tense to indicate an action that started in the past (2010) and continues to the present. 'Have' is incorrectly conjugated for 'He', and 'had worked' implies a completed action in the past, making it unsuitable in this context.",,,
2,786,guest,,,,,,
2,787,to,,,,,,
2,788,difficult,,,,,,
2,789,that,which,,"Both 'that' and 'which' can be used in defining (restrictive) relative clauses referring to animals. 'That' is more commonly used in American English for restrictive clauses, while 'which' is acceptable in British English when used restrictively. 'Whom' is incorrect because it refers to people, not animals.",,,
2,790,that,,,"The structure 'so ... that' is used to express a result or consequence, which fits the sentence 'The test was so easy ___ everyone passed.' 'Because' does not create the same comparative structure, and 'than' is used for comparisons rather than causal relationships.",,,
2,791,snows,,,,,,
2,792,sweet,,,,,,
2,793,was,,,,,,
2,794,something,,,"The correct answer is 'something' because the sentence refers to finding an object in the attic, which aligns with the Korean translation that uses a neuter object. 'Someone' implies a person, and 'anything' would suggest a lack of specificity that doesn’t match the context of the surprise discovery. Thus, 'something' is the most appropriate choice.",,,
2,795,tidily,,,"The sentence requires an adverb to modify the verb 'kept', describing how the room was maintained. 'Tidily' is an adverb meaning in a neat or orderly manner, which matches the Korean description '깔끔하게'. 'Tidy' is an adjective and 'tidiest' is a superlative adjective, so neither fit grammatically.",,,

2,797,writing,,,,,,
2,798,to sing,,,,,,
2,799,travel,,,,,,
2,800,enjoy,,,"The choice 'enjoy' fits best in the context of the sentence. In the quiz, 'Do you enjoy your lunch break?' is a natural and idiomatic way to inquire if someone takes pleasure in their lunch break. 'Like' is less precise in this context, and 'love' is too strong and less common when talking about a routine activity such as a lunch break.",,,

2,806,I’m certain that,,,,,,
2,807,From my perspective,I think that,,"Both 'From my perspective' and 'I think that' can be used to translate the Korean phrase '내 생각에는', which indicates that the sentence expresses a personal opinion.
 
 1. Using 'From my perspective' gives the sentence a nuance of stating an opinion clearly: ""From my perspective, learning languages is important."" Even though in the quiz the word 'that' remains after the blank, it can be seen as a stylistic inclusion.
 
 2. 'I think that' is another natural way to express personal belief. In a typical sentence, one would say ""I think that learning languages is important."" The quiz leaves a 'that' after the blank, but this can be interpreted as part of a scripting pattern where the blank is filled by the opinion expression. 
 
 3. 'Honestly,' does not convey the same specific meaning of personal opinion as emphasized in the Korean sentence.
 
 Thus, 'From my perspective' and 'I think that' are both reasonable answers.",,,
2,808,excited,,,,,,
2,809,favorite,,,,,,
2,810,check,,,"The Korean translation '숙제를 확인하는 것을 기억하세요' indicates that the sentence is prompting the listener to remember to check their homework. 'Check' fits the context correctly, while 'skip' and 'neglect' have negative connotations that do not match the intended meaning of confirming or reviewing homework.",,,
2,811,use,,,,,,
2,812,possible,likely,,"The sentence in English 'It’s ___ that we will have a picnic.' paired with the Korean '우리에게 소풍 갈 가능성이 있어요.' indicates a possibility rather than certainty. Both 'possible' and 'likely' fit naturally here:
 
 1. 'Possible' directly conveys the idea of something that might happen.
 2. 'Likely' implies a high probability, which also aligns with the concept of possibility expressed in Korean.
 
 'Certain' would imply that the picnic will definitely happen, which does not match the intended meaning.",,,
2,813,have been collecting,have collected,,"Both 'have been collecting' and 'have collected' are grammatically correct and semantically consistent with the Korean sentence, which implies an ongoing or completed collection of memories over the year.
 
 1. 'Have been collecting' emphasizes the continuous nature of the action throughout the year, aligning with the idea of '모아왔어요' which suggests a continuous accumulation.
 2. 'Have collected' indicates that the action is completed up to the present, which also fits the context since the memories have been gathered over the year.
 3. 'Had been collecting' implies a past activity that was completed before another past action, which does not match the context of the sentence.",,,
2,814,which,,,"The word 'which' is the correct choice because it is used to introduce a non-restrictive relative clause, which is appropriate here as it adds extra information about the healthy food. 'That' would typically not be preceded by a comma in such constructions, and 'who' is used for people, not things.",,,
2,815,prepared,,,,,,
2,816,if,,,,,,
2,817,to use renewable energy sources,,,"The sentence requires an infinitive form after 'vital for us', and 'to use renewable energy sources' is grammatically correct and matches the given context. 'Using renewable energy sources' would be less appropriate in this structure, and 'use renewable energy source' lacks the necessary 'to' and does not correctly pluralize 'energy source'.",,,
2,818,stock,,,"The word 'stock' means to store or keep in supply, which fits logically in the sentence 'The fewer items we stock, the more space we have.' 'Stuck' means being unable to move and 'stick' as a verb means to attach, both of which do not fit the context of storing items.",,,
2,819,had,,,,,,
2,820,what,,,"The word 'what' fits naturally in the sentence 'Uncover what drives your ambition.' It is used to inquire about the unknown element that fuels your ambition, matching the Korean meaning. 'Which' and 'that' do not properly function in this interrogative context.",,,
2,821,including,,,,,,
2,822,Since,Because,,"Both 'Since' and 'Because' can indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between the speaker's inexperience at navigating a busy market and their inability to find their way. 'Because' directly explains that the inexperience caused the difficulty, while 'Since' also serves as a causal conjunction in this context. 'Although' would imply a contrast rather than a cause, making it less appropriate for this sentence.",,,
2,823,should be valued,,,"The phrase 'should be valued' is a passive construction, which fits the context of the sentence (저와 같은 사람은 모두에게 소중히 여겨져야 해요) perfectly. The other options are not grammatically suitable in this context.",,,
2,824,where,,,"The word 'where' is the correct answer because it indicates the location (library) where digital resources are available. 'Why' is used for reasons and 'when' for time, neither of which fits the context of the sentence.",,,
2,825,Seeing,,,,,,
2,826,so that,,,,,,
2,827,In my view,,,"The phrase 'In my view' directly translates to '내가 보기에' and fits naturally in the sentence to express a personal opinion. The other options, 'I think that' and 'I believe that', typically require a following clause and do not match the structure and nuance of the Korean sentence.",,,

2,840,bring,,,"In the Korean sentence, '숙제를 가져오는 것을 확실히 하세요' directly translates to 'make sure to bring your homework.' This makes 'bring' the most fitting choice, as 'take' would imply a different meaning and 'forget' is completely out of context.",,,
2,841,to,,,,,,
2,842,in Europe,,,,,,
2,843,what,,,"In this sentence, 'what' serves as a relative pronoun that introduces a noun clause ('what their friends share'), which correctly refers to the things that their friends share and that they enjoy. The options 'who' (referring to people) and 'that' (which does not form a complete noun clause in this context) do not fit grammatically.",,,

2,857,can,,,"In the phrase 'What can I get you?' the auxiliary 'can' is used to offer help or service, which is the most idiomatic and natural choice in a customer service context. 'Do' doesn't fit grammatically, and 'will' is less common in this context.",,,
2,858,dining in,,,,,,
2,859,explain,,,"The word 'explain' best fits the context of the question ""Can you ___ to me?"" and the Korean sentence '내게 설명해줄 수 있니?'. The sentence is asking for an explanation, making 'explain' the appropriate choice. 'Forget' and 'interrupt' do not match the request for an explanation.",,,
2,860,repeat,,,,,,
2,861,switch,swap,,"Both 'switch' and 'swap' can be used to indicate exchanging one thing for another in everyday conversation. 'Swap' is often the more direct synonym of 'trade', especially in the context of exchanging items, and 'switch' can also be informally used to mean making an exchange. 'Change' is less appropriate here because it typically implies a difference in condition or state rather than a reciprocal exchange.",,,
2,862,return,,,,,,
2,863,usually,,,,,,
2,864,try,,,,,,
2,865,completing,,,"The sentence congratulates on finishing something, and the Korean sentence confirms that it is about completing the task. 'Completing' is the correct answer because it closely matches the idea of finishing the assignment, while 'starting' and 'ignoring' do not fit the context.",,,
2,866,sad,,,,,,
2,867,bake a cake,,,,,,
2,868,your help,,,,,,
2,869,pick,choose,,"Both 'pick' and 'choose' correctly convey the meaning of 'select' as indicated by the Korean sentence 의미 '나는 겨울을 선택할 거야.' 'Opt' is not as suitable here because it is typically used with 'for' (e.g., 'opt for') and doesn't fit naturally in the blank by itself.",,,
2,870,It seems to me that,"In my opinion,",,"Both 'It seems to me that' and 'In my opinion,' can appropriately introduce a statement expressing a personal view without causing redundancy in the sentence structure. Since the second sentence already uses 'I believe that', using one of these in the first sentence avoids repetition while still conveying the speaker's opinion. 'I believe that' would be redundant if used twice, so it is not selected.",,,
2,871,if,,,,,,
2,872,makes,,,,,,
2,873,which means,that means,,"Both 'which means' and 'that means' correctly link the origin of the word 'cookie' to its meaning 'little cake.'
 
 1. 'Which means' is a standard connective used to explain or elaborate on a previous statement.
 2. 'That means' is also used to denote the definition or implication of the preceding information.
 3. 'Who means' is incorrect because 'who' refers to a person, not a word.
 
 Thus, both 'which means' and 'that means' are appropriate choices.",,,
2,874,looking,,,,,,
2,875,wearing,,,,,,
2,876,visited,,,,,,
2,877,Using,,,The sentence requires an introductory participle phrase. 'Using innovative apps' is grammatically correct and functions as an adverbial phrase describing how teens create digital art. 'Uses' and 'Used' do not fit the sentence structure.,,,
2,878,to,,,,,,
2,879,to watch,,,The phrase 'got a chance to watch' is a fixed expression in English. 'To watch' is used after 'chance' to indicate the opportunity to do something. The alternatives 'watching' and 'watch' do not grammatically fit in this context.,,,
2,880,so that,,,,,,
2,881,seems clear,,,,,,
2,882,where,,,"The sentence is asking about the location (‘어디서’) to find a great deal. 'Where' directly relates to the question, while 'when' is about time and 'what' doesn't fit the context.",,,
2,883,as,,,,,,
2,884,what,,,,,,
2,885,As,,,,,,
2,886,were,,,"The correct option is 'were' because the sentence is a second conditional statement which requires the subjunctive mood. 'Were' is traditionally used with 'if I' in hypothetical past situations, whereas 'was' is indicative and less formal, and 'are' is incorrect in this context.",,,
2,887,great,,,,,,
2,888,sorry,,,,,,
2,889,concerned,anxious,,"Both 'concerned' and 'anxious' can be correct as they relate to feelings of worry. The Korean sentence implies a state of being worried about savings. 'Concerned' directly translates to being worried or preoccupied about something, which fits naturally. 'Anxious' also implies a state of nervousness or worry. 'Confident', on the other hand, carries a positive connotation and does not match the worried tone of the Korean sentence. Therefore, 'concerned' and 'anxious' are the appropriate choices.",,,
2,890,cook pasta,,,,,,
2,891,help,,,,,,
2,892,lock,,,,,,
2,893,online classes,,,,,,
2,894,totally,,,"The option 'totally' best matches the Korean word '완전히', and the phrase 'I totally agree' is the conventional expression used to indicate complete agreement. 'Really agree' is less common in this context, and 'hardly agree' changes the meaning to imply little or no agreement.",,,
2,895,taken,,,"The sentence 'I wish I had taken it.' correctly reflects the regret of not having the umbrella with you, matching the Korean sentence '내 우산을 챙겼어야 했어.' In contrast, 'brought' and 'found' do not convey the intended meaning. 'Taken' is the best fit.",,,
2,896,succeed,,,,,,
2,897,your help,,,,,,
2,898,shouldn't,,,,,,
2,899,know,hear,,"Both 'know' and 'hear' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Interested to know' is a common collocation when asking for information about event details. Similarly, 'interested to hear' conveys the speaker's desire to listen to or receive confirmation about the details. 'Learn' is less appropriate in this context as it typically implies acquiring knowledge through effort or study rather than hearing or being informed. Therefore, 'know' and 'hear' are both suitable choices.",,,
2,900,drinking water is good for your skin,,,"The Korean sentence translates to '인터넷에서는 물을 마시면 피부에 좋다고 말해,' which means 'The Internet says that drinking water is good for your skin.' Only option_2 aligns perfectly with both the meaning of the provided Korean sentence and the structure of the quiz sentence.",,,
2,901,brought,,,,,,
2,902,do well,,,The Korean sentence '내가 진정 원하는 것은 네가 잘하길 바라는 거야' translates to 'What I really want is for you to do well.' This means that the speaker hopes the addressed person performs well. The option 'do well' exactly matches this meaning. The other options 'finish early' and 'try hard' do not correspond to the context of performing well.,,,
2,903,for us to finish the project on time,,,,,,
2,904,participate,,,,,,
2,905,let,had,,"The sentence in Korean indicates that the coach made the subject practice extra, and both 'let' and 'had' can convey a causative meaning in English. 
 
 1. 'Let' is used to mean 'allow someone to do something', which fits naturally in this sentence.
 2. 'Had' can be used as a causative verb meaning 'to cause someone to do something' (e.g., 'My coach had me practice extra'), which also matches the intended meaning.
 3. 'Got' would require an additional word (such as 'to' before 'practice') and is less natural in this context.",,,

2,917,while,,,,,,
2,918,had discovered,discovered,,"Both 'had discovered' and 'discovered' can be considered correct in this sentence. 'Had discovered' uses the past perfect tense, which clearly indicates that the discovery occurred prior to the teacher's explanation. On the other hand, 'discovered' in simple past is also acceptable in reported speech contexts where the sequence of events is understood from the context. 'Has discovered' is incorrect because the present perfect does not align with the past narrative of the teacher's explanation.",,,
2,919,the mistake,,,,,,
2,920,took,,,"The idiomatic expression is 'took it the wrong way', which means to misunderstand someone. 'Took' fits the meaning perfectly, while 'gave' and 'saw' do not make sense in this context.",,,
2,921,looking forward to,,,,,,
2,922,I heard it somewhere that,,,"Option 3, 'I heard it somewhere that', matches the additional information in the Korean sentence '어딘가서 들었는데', which indicates that the speaker heard the information from somewhere. Options 1 and 2 express personal opinions rather than a report of where the information was obtained.",,,
2,923,Someone told me that,,,,,,
2,924,leave,,,,,,
2,925,challenging,difficult,,"Both 'challenging' and 'difficult' can express that waking up early is not easy. In Korean, '어렵다' is used, which directly translates to 'difficult,' making it the most straightforward choice. However, 'challenging' also conveys that the activity requires effort and can be seen as a more nuanced way of saying it's hard, so it is an acceptable alternative.",,,
2,926,visit,,,,,,
2,927,give me more information about,,,"Option 2, 'give me more information about', is the most natural choice for asking someone to provide additional details about their plan, which directly corresponds with the Korean sentence asking for a more detailed explanation of the plan. Option 1 ('tell me something about') is less precise and more informal, and option 3 ('speak about') doesn't naturally imply providing additional details.",,,
2,928,think,hold,,"Both 'think' and 'hold' can work in the sentence.
 1. 'Think' fits because asking 'Why do you think that view?' means 'Why do you believe that view?', which is a common way to ask for someone's reasoning behind an opinion.
 2. 'Hold' fits because 'to hold a view' is an idiomatic expression meaning to maintain or have a particular belief, making the sentence 'Why do you hold that view?' equally natural.
 3. 'Keep' is less appropriate because it is not commonly used in the context of opinions or beliefs.",,,

2,932,planned better,,,,,,
2,933,change the date of the meeting,,,"The option 'change the date of the meeting' directly corresponds to the meaning of the Korean sentence, which asks if the meeting date can be changed. The other options do not match the intended meaning.",,,
2,934,Visiting Paris,,,,,,
2,935,what,,,,,,
2,936,to relax,,,The phrase 'to relax' correctly completes the sentence by using an infinitive that explains the purpose of visiting the forest for bird watchers. It implies that forests are the best place for bird watchers to relax. The other options do not form a grammatically correct sentence.,,,
2,937,if,,,,,,
2,938,inspired,,,,,,
2,939,thinking,,,The correct answer is 'thinking' because it uses the present participle form to indicate that the action of analyzing the ancient writings occurred while simultaneously considering their meanings. The other options do not grammatically fit in the sentence.,,,

2,948,repaired,,,"The sentence is in the passive voice and implies that a skilled mechanic performed the repair. 'Repaired' is the past participle used to form the passive construction. 'Repair' would be the base form and 'repairing' the present participle, neither of which are appropriate in this context.",,,
2,949,enjoy,,,"The sentence subject 'friends' is plural, so the correct verb form is 'enjoy'. 'Enjoys' is singular and 'enjoyed' is past tense, neither of which match the context of a habitual action expressed in the Korean sentence.",,,
2,950,with circuits lighting up,,,,,,
2,951,happy,glad,,"Both 'happy' and 'glad' accurately reflect the positive emotion expressed in the Korean sentence, which means 'I am happy to join the event.' While 'happy' is a common expression, 'glad' is a synonym and equally appropriate in this context. 'Worried' does not match the intended positive emotion.",,,
2,952,I totally agree with you.,,,,,,
2,953,prefer,,,"The Korean text clearly asks about one's preference (선호) which directly corresponds to the English word 'prefer'. While 'like' might be grammatically acceptable in a casual context, the desire to express a clear preference aligns best with 'prefer', especially given the response 'I prefer apples.' 'Choose' does not fit the context of expressing preference.",,,
2,954,explain,,,"The Korean sentence '한번 더 설명해줄 수 있어?' directly translates to asking for an explanation, which makes 'explain' the most appropriate choice. While 'repeat' and 'describe' might have similar meanings in some contexts, they do not accurately capture the request for explanation indicated by the Korean sentence.",,,
2,955,talk,speak,,"Both 'talk' and 'speak' can appropriately fill the blank in the sentence. 'Let me talk about my favorite hobby.' is the more common, conversational option, while 'Let me speak about my favorite hobby.' is grammatically correct and acceptable, though slightly more formal. 'Introduce' does not fit the context because it typically means to present or make someone known, which doesn't align with the intended meaning of discussing a hobby.",,,

2,957,where,,,,,,
2,958,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' convey the same meaning of providing aid or support in response to the question, 'Would you like me to ___?'. Although 'assist' is more formal, it fits grammatically, while 'help' is more common and natural in everyday usage. 'Support' is less suitable in this context because it generally refers to providing backing or encouragement rather than direct aid.",,,
2,959,recommend,,,,,,
2,960,I can't wait to,,,"The sentence 'I can't wait to try the new restaurant.' is grammatically correct and a common expression to convey enthusiasm for trying something. The other options require a gerund form (e.g., 'trying') which is not provided, making 'I can't wait to' the only natural and grammatically appropriate choice.",,,

2,963,remember,,,,,,

2,965,shouldn't have,,,,,,
2,966,correct,,,,,,
2,967,what,,,"The sentence 'He remembered what made him smile.' is grammatically correct because 'what' functions as a fused relative pronoun, meaning 'the thing that'. 'That' and 'which' would require an antecedent noun to modify, which is not present in the sentence, making them incorrect choices.",,,
2,968,hopping,,,"The sentence describes the action of the rabbit, and 'hopping' is the present participle that properly functions as an adjective modifying 'rabbit'.
 
 1. 'hopping' fits grammatically and semantically with the idea of an active, moving rabbit.
 2. 'hoped' is the past form of 'hope' and illogical in this context.
 3. 'hop' would serve as a simple verb or noun but does not correctly modify 'rabbit' in this construction.",,,
2,969,has been,,,,,,
2,970,when I watch the sunset on Friday evenings,,,,,,
2,971,had already left,,,,,,
2,972,necessary,,,,,,
2,973,listening,,,"The word 'listening' is the correct choice because it acts as a present participle, indicating an action that happens simultaneously with crossing the road. 'Listen' (base form) and 'listened' (past tense) do not grammatically fit in the sentence structure.",,,
2,974,might have been,,,,,,
2,975,watched,,,,,,
2,976,Though,,,,,,
2,977,so delicious,,,"The construction 'so ... that' is expected in the sentence. 'So delicious' correctly forms the structure 'The food was so delicious that I asked for the recipe.' Meanwhile, 'delicious' and 'very delicious' do not provide the causal connection needed in this sentence.",,,
2,978,whether,,,,,,
2,979,my teacher,,,,,,
2,980,knew,,,,,,
2,981,will,,,,,,
2,982,who,,,"The correct answer is 'who' because it is used to refer to a person who performs the action in the sentence. In this case, the subject 'someone' always tells honest stories. 'Whom' is typically used as an object, and 'which' is used for non-human things, making them both inappropriate in this context.",,,
2,983,How are you feeling right now?,How do you feel right now?,,Both 'How are you feeling right now?' and 'How do you feel right now?' naturally fit the blank in the question. They are grammatically correct and correspond to the Korean sentence asking about one's current mood. 'What are you doing right now?' is not suitable because it inquires about an activity rather than one's feeling.,,,
2,984,happy,,,"The phrase 'I'm happy for you' correctly corresponds to the Korean sentence which expresses being glad for someone's success. 'Proud' would imply a sense of personal achievement or admiration, which doesn't match the context, and 'sorry' conveys apology, which is inappropriate here.",,,

2,998,Take,,,,,,
2,999,what song lifts her mood,what song lifted her mood,,"Both 'what song lifts her mood' and 'what song lifted her mood' can be acceptable in this context. Option 1 uses the simple present tense, which is often used in indirect questions that describe a general or habitual fact (in this case, the song that makes her feel better), matching the Korean phrase '좋게 만드는.' Option 3 uses the simple past tense, aligning with the main verb 'asked' in the past, which is also acceptable in indirect reported speech. Option 2 is grammatically incorrect as it lacks the necessary verb agreement.",,,
2,1000,organized,,,,,,
2,1001,enough,,,,,,
2,1002,Watching,,,,,,
2,1003,would,,,The correct answer is 'would' because the sentence uses a conditional structure indicated by 'if she visited another country' and the corresponding appropriate modal verb in the main clause should be 'would' to denote the hypothetical scenario. 'Will' and 'did' do not match this past counterfactual conditional form.,,,
2,1004,cleaner,,,,,,
2,1005,was reading,,,"Only 'was reading' accurately reflects the past continuous tense suggested by the indirect speech in the Korean sentence. The expression '읽고 계셨다' implies an ongoing action in the past, which fits best with the past continuous form 'was reading'.",,,
2,1006,others,,,,,,
2,1007,which inspire confidence,,,"The phrase 'which inspire confidence' is the correct option because it correctly refers back to 'compliments' which are things. 'Who' would typically be used for people, and 'what' is grammatically incorrect in this context. Thus, 'which inspire confidence' is the proper choice.",,,
2,1008,much greener,greener,,"Both 'much greener' and 'greener' could be seen as acceptable answers. The Korean sentence uses '훨씬', which means 'much', so 'much greener' is a precise match. However, 'greener' is also grammatically correct in English and can be used to express the comparative degree of greenness. 'More greener' is incorrect because it redundantly repeats the comparative marker. Therefore, both 'much greener' and 'greener' are possible answers.",,,
2,1009,act,,,,,,
2,1010,what,,,,,,
2,1011,whose,,,"The option 'whose' is the correct choice because it shows possession for a person (a friend). 'Which' is typically used for things, and 'who's' is a contraction for 'who is' and is not possessive.",,,
2,1012,these,,,"The sentence refers to eco-friendly practices as a plural subject, so 'these' is the appropriate demonstrative adjective. 'This' and 'that' are singular and do not correctly match the plural noun 'practices', making them unsuitable choices.",,,
2,1013,real,,,,,,
2,1014,told,,,"The correct answer is 'told' because the sentence requires a verb that means 'to instruct or direct someone to do something'. Here, 'told' fits as it means that the manager instructed them to start a new project. 'Saw' and 'sang' do not convey that meaning.",,,
2,1015,curious,,,"The word 'curious' is the most natural choice because the Korean sentence expresses a desire to know more about someone's idea, which directly translates to being 'curious'. Although 'excited' is grammatically correct, it conveys a different emotional tone that doesn’t match the context as closely. 'Bored' is clearly inappropriate given the context.",,,
2,1016,favorite,,,,,,
2,1017,What do you suggest,,,,,,
2,1018,forget,,,,,,
2,1019,confident,,,,,,
2,1020,I believe that,I think that,,"Both 'I believe that' and 'I think that' are commonly used to express an opinion, which matches the Korean sentence meaning 'in my opinion, she is very talented.' 'I believe that' emphasizes a strong conviction, while 'I think that' is a general statement of opinion. 'I feel that' is typically used to express a personal emotion rather than an opinion about someone's talent, hence it is less appropriate in this context.",,,
2,1021,should,had better,,"Both 'should' and 'had better' can be used to give advice, which fits the intended meaning of the Korean sentence '너는 휴식을 취하는 게 좋을 거야.'
 
 1. 'Should' is a common modal verb used to give suggestions or advice.
 2. 'Had better' is also used for giving strong advice or recommendation, implying a recommendation to take a break.
 3. 'Would' does not appropriately convey the intended advisory message in this context.
 
 Thus, both 'should' and 'had better' could be considered correct answers.",,,
2,1022,should,,,,,,
2,1023,are aware of,know about,,"Both 'are aware of' and 'know about' fit the sentence naturally when asking if someone is informed or conscious of climate change. The Korean phrase '인식하고 있지' suggests a state of being aware or knowledgeable about something, which matches both choices. 'Have heard of' is less suitable because it only implies a minimal or casual recognition rather than the state of being informed.",,,
2,1024,can't wait,,,,,,
2,1025,talk,,,,,,
2,1026,Would you like to,,,,,,
2,1027,turn down,,,"The phrase 'turn down' means to lower the volume of music, which directly corresponds to the Korean request to reduce the volume. 'Raise' would mean to increase which is opposite, and 'ignore' does not appropriately ask for a volume adjustment.",,,
2,1028,grateful,,,,,,
2,1029,amazed,,,,,,
2,1030,satisfied,,,,,,
2,1031,feasible,possible,,"Both 'feasible' and 'possible' appropriately fit in the sentence. 'Feasible' is often used to indicate that something is practically attainable and aligns with the context of completing an assignment on time. 'Possible' also works as it asks whether it is within the realm of possibility for them to finish the assignment. 'Impractical' does not fit because it conveys a negative implication, suggesting that completing the assignment on time is unworkable.",,,
2,1032,I want to,,,,,,
2,1033,do,,,,,,
2,1034,has been visiting,,,"The sentence requires the correct present perfect continuous form for a singular subject ('he'). 'Has been visiting' is the grammatically correct option matching the sentence structure and meaning. 'Have been visiting' is incorrect because it requires a plural subject, and 'has visiting' lacks the necessary auxiliary 'been'.",,,
2,1035,challenging internship,,,,,,
2,1036,to,,,,,,
2,1037,had prepared,,,"The past perfect tense 'had prepared' is the most appropriate option because it indicates that the preparation of the speech was completed before the national event began. This sequence of events aligns with the intended meaning in the sentence. Although 'prepared' (simple past) might seem acceptable, the past perfect form better emphasizes the prior completion of the action, and 'has prepared' is incorrect because it implies a connection to the present.",,,
2,1038,introduces,,,,,,
2,1039,how,,,,,,
2,1040,"Using vivid colors,",,,"The phrase 'Using vivid colors,' is correct because it uses 'vivid' as an adjective to describe the colors, which is grammatically proper and matches the intended meaning of using bright, intense colors in street art. 'Using vivid color,' is less natural as it suggests a single color, and 'Using vividly colors,' incorrectly uses an adverb instead of an adjective.",,,
2,1041,had,,,,,,
2,1042,what,,,"The sentence 'My dream is what keeps me going.' is an idiomatic way to express that one's dream is the driving force behind their actions. In this structure, 'what' functions as a fused relative pronoun meaning 'the thing that', which naturally fits the sentence. The alternatives 'that' and 'which' do not provide the same idiomatic meaning in this context.",,,
2,1043,walking,,,,,,
2,1044,had,,,,,,
2,1045,might have felt,,,,,,
2,1046,so that,,,"The phrase 'so that' fits best because it expresses the purpose of visiting national monuments, which aligns with the idea of keeping memories alive. 'If' does not convey purpose, and 'because' provides a reason rather than a purpose, making it less suitable in this context.",,,

2,1054,nervous,,,,,,
2,1055,be honest,,,"The sentence 'Don’t you think ______ is important?' aligns with the idea that honesty is being questioned. 'Be honest' corresponds to 정직함, making it the suitable choice. 'Be careful' and 'be noisy' do not fit the context.",,,
2,1056,buying a bigger one,,,,,,
2,1057,must,,,,,,
2,1058,might,could,,"Both 'might' and 'could' are used to express possibility. In the sentence 'She ___ solve this problem', both options naturally indicate that she may solve the problem. 'Might' directly indicates possibility, while 'could' also suggests the potential ability or possibility to solve the problem. 'Should' would imply an expectation or recommendation, which does not match the meaning of the Korean sentence.",,,
2,1059,explain,,,,,,
2,1060,alternatives,,,"The term 'alternatives' best fits the meaning of 대안 in Korean, referring to different options or substitute proposals for a plan. 'Modifications' would imply changes made to the plan and 'selections' would indicate choices among existing options, which do not match the intended meaning in this context.",,,
2,1061,sit,,,,,,

2,1067,determined,,,,,,
2,1068,thinking that exercise improves mood,,,"The sentence requires a participial phrase that describes Hyun's habitual thought process, which matches the construction 'thinking that exercise improves mood.' This option correctly expresses an ongoing thought (as indicated by the Korean sentence using present continuous meaning) and fits grammatically within the sentence. The other options either do not align with the grammatical structure or change the tense inappropriately.",,,

2,1074,but also,,,"The idiom 'not only ... but also' is used to connect two complementary adjectives or phrases. In this sentence, it is used to enhance the description of the green smoothie by pairing 'energizing' with 'delicious', which matches the Korean translation. The other options do not provide the appropriate contrast needed in this structure.",,,
2,1075,not to forget,,,,,,
2,1076,if,when,,"Both 'if' and 'when' work naturally in the sentence. 'If' matches the conditional nature of the Korean sentence ('걱정을 나누고 싶다면'), implying that, provided you want to share your worries, you should call a friend. 'When' is also acceptable because it indicates that on the occasion you feel like sharing your worries, you call a friend. 'Because' does not fit grammatically as it would incorrectly signal a reason rather than a condition.",,,

2,1083,plan,schedule,,"Both 'plan' and 'schedule' fit naturally in the context of asking about one's weekend arrangements as referred to by the Korean '주말 계획'. 'Plan' is a direct translation of '계획', making it the most straightforward choice. 'Schedule' can also be appropriate when referring to a set itinerary or planned activities. 'Choice' does not capture the intended meaning here.",,,

2,1097,What,,,The sentence 'What you believe shapes your future' is a common structure meaning that the things one believes determine or influence one's future. Option 1 ('Which you believe shapes your future') and Option 2 ('That you believe shapes your future') do not naturally fit in this declarative sentence structure.,,,
2,1098,Even though,Although,,"Both 'Even though' and 'Although' are subordinating conjunctions that can be used to introduce a contrast clause, fitting well in the sentence structure '___ the weather was bad, they continued their trip.' Although 'Despite' is similar in meaning, it is not grammatically appropriate here because it is followed by a noun phrase rather than a full clause.",,,
2,1099,in Paris,,,,,,
2,1100,which,,,"In non-restrictive relative clauses referring to animals, 'which' is the most appropriate relative pronoun. The sentence 'She adopted a cat, which had been abandoned.' correctly uses a non-restrictive clause to provide additional information about the cat. 'Who' is typically used for people, and 'that' is generally used in restrictive clauses, not when a comma is present.",,,

2,1107,where,,,"The word 'where' is the most natural choice because it specifically indicates a location, which suits the sentence 'I know a place where you can relax.' The other options, 'that' and 'which,' do not convey the intended spatial meaning and do not fit as naturally in this context.",,,
2,1108,Thus,,,"The sentence implies a cause and effect relationship where she wanted to lose weight and as a result, she started exercising. 'Thus' correctly reflects this consequence (hence, so). In contrast, 'However' and 'But' indicate contradiction, making them inappropriate choices.",,,
2,1109,whose,,,"The word 'whose' is the correct choice because it is used to indicate possession. In the sentence, 'houses are made of wood' belongs to the village, so 'whose' correctly links the village with its houses. 'Who' refers to people and 'that' would not properly indicate possession.",,,
