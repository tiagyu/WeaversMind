1,10001,Hello!,Hi!,,"The Korean '안녕하세요!' translates to a greeting meaning 'Hello!' or similar, which fits both the 'Hello!' and 'Hi!' options. 'Goodbye!' is the opposite of the intended meaning. Therefore, both 'Hello!' and 'Hi!' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,10002,I’m,,,,,,
1,10003,Thanks,,,"The sentence 'Thanks a lot' is a common expression of gratitude that fits naturally into the sentence structure, especially given the informal tone indicated by 'No problem' in response. 'Thankful' is an adjective and can't be used in this context, and 'Thank' is not correct without the 'you' attached.",,,
1,10004,sorry,,,,,,
1,10005,that,this,,"Both 'that' and 'this' are plausible choices for the blank because they are singular demonstrative pronouns used to refer to an object, and both can be used in the question ""What's ___?"" to identify an object such as a kite. 'That' is commonly used when referring to something a bit farther away, while 'this' is used when referring to something close by. Since the context does not specify the object's location, both options are acceptable. 'These' is excluded because it refers to plural objects.",,,
1,10006,Be quiet,,,,,,
1,10007,Okay,,,,,,
1,10008,oranges,,,,,,
1,10009,pen,ruler,book,"All three options fit naturally into the sentence ""Do you have a ___?"" and are appropriate objects that one might possess. The dialogue is generic and does not specify a particular object; therefore, asking if someone has a pen, a ruler, or a book all produce valid responses. Since the conversation could refer to any item, all three choices are possible answers.",,,

1,10017,uncle,,,,,,
1,10018,kind,,,,,,
1,10019,What's,How's,,"Both 'What's' and 'How's' fit naturally in the sentence when asking about the weather. 'What's the weather today?' and 'How's the weather today?' are commonly used expressions, whereas 'When's the weather today?' does not make sense in this context.",,,
1,10020,go hiking,,,,,,
1,10021,Hello,,,,,,
1,10022,Alex,,,,,,
1,10023,Goodbye!,,,,,,
1,10024,What's,,,,,,
1,10025,large,,,,,,
1,10026,Close,,,,,,
1,10027,Fantastic!,,,"The Korean exclamation '환상적이야' directly translates to 'Fantastic!' The enthusiasm and the meaning of the exclamation match best with 'Fantastic!' compared to the other options, which are less direct translations.",,,
1,10028,like,,,,,,
1,10029,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' work well in the sentence as they convey a positive feeling towards fruits. The Korean sentence uses '즐겨요', which translates well to either 'like' or 'enjoy', while 'despise' has the opposite meaning.",,,
1,10030,How are you?,How have you been?,,"Both 'How are you?' and 'How have you been?' naturally fit the casual greeting '어떻게 지내?'.
 
 1. 'How are you?' is a standard greeting in English for asking about someone's current state, which matches the informal nature of '어떻게 지내?'.
 2. 'How have you been?' is also appropriate as it inquires about someone's well-being over a period of time, which can still be a suitable response given the context of the Korean sentence.
 
 Option 'What's up?' is more informal and colloquial and does not align as well with the formal greeting implied by the Korean sentence.",,,
1,10031,Good,,,,,,

1,10036,blue,,,,,,
1,10037,you,,,,,,
1,10038,eat,,,,,,
1,10039,Have,Enjoy,,"Both 'Have' and 'Enjoy' can naturally complete the phrase as a farewell greeting. 'Have' is common in expressions like 'Have a great day,' while 'Enjoy' fits the idea of having fun or pleasant experiences throughout the day, matching the sentiment of the Korean phrase '즐거운 하루 보내세요!'. 'Love' does not align with the intended meaning.",,,
1,10040,have,,,,,,
1,10041,Here,,,,,,
1,10042,How,,,,,,
1,10043,Happy birthday,,,,,,
1,10044,Don't shout,,,,,,
1,10045,Be careful,Watch out,Look out,"All three options can naturally be used to warn someone about an oncoming car.
 
 1. 'Be careful' is a common way to advise someone to stay alert and safe.
 2. 'Watch out' directly warns someone to look out for danger.
 3. 'Look out' similarly alerts someone to potential hazard.
 
 Thus, each option fits the context of the Korean sentence '조심해! 차가 오고 있어.' and is acceptable.",,,
1,10046,cloudy,,,,,,
1,10047,Bye,,,,,,
1,10048,Hello,Hi,,"Both 'Hello' and 'Hi' are common greetings that match the Korean greeting '안녕하세요!'. While both are acceptable in this context, 'Bye' is incorrect since it means the opposite of greeting.",,,
1,10049,What,,,,,,
1,10050,that,,,,,,
1,10051,Look,,,,,,
1,10052,Open,,,,,,
1,10053,Awesome!,Amazing!,Terrific!,"All three options can naturally complete the sentence as an exclamation of praise. In the context of expressing an outstanding performance, 'Awesome!', 'Amazing!', and 'Terrific!' all convey excitement and approval. Therefore, each option is an acceptable answer.",,,
1,10054,bananas,,,,,,
1,10055,like,,,,,,
1,10056,don't,,,,,,
1,10057,How many,,,The expression 'How many' is used when asking about countable items such as books. 'What many' and 'How much' do not fit grammatically or contextually in asking about the number of books.,,,
1,10058,huge,,,,,,
1,10059,Have you got,Do you have,,"Both 'Have you got' and 'Do you have' are common ways to ask about possession in English, especially in informal contexts. 'Do you own' is less natural here, as it has a stronger implication of possession in a more formal or permanent sense, which does not quite match the casual inquiry implied in the question.",,,
1,10060,have,,,,,,
1,10061,Thank you,,,"The Korean sentence '식사에 대해 감사합니다' means 'Thank you for the meal,' which aligns directly with Option 2. Options 1 ('You're welcome') and 3 ('No problem') are responses typically given after someone expresses gratitude, so they do not fit the intended meaning of the quiz sentence.",,,
1,10062,Can,,,,,,
1,10063,can,,,,,,
1,10064,can't,,,,,,
1,10065,believe,,,,,,
1,10066,climb,,,,,,
1,10067,Walk carefully,Be cautious,,"Both 'Walk carefully' and 'Be cautious' capture the essence of the Korean sentence, which is advising someone to exercise caution when using the stairs. 'Walk carefully' directly instructs one to be mindful of one’s walking manner, while 'Be cautious' broadly advises caution. 'Stay alert' while similar in meaning, is less directly related to the physical action of walking carefully on the stairs.",,,
1,10068,I'm sorry,,,,,,
1,10069,she,,,,,,
1,10070,tall,,,,,,
1,10071,green,,,,,,
1,10072,Look,,,The phrase 'Look at this!' is the natural English command corresponding to the Korean '이거 봐!'. 'Look' is the most common way to direct someone’s attention to something. 'See' and 'Notice' do not fit as naturally in this imperative construction.,,,
1,10073,How old,,,,,,
1,10074,Happy,,,,,,
1,10075,sunny,,,,,,
1,10076,Shall,,,,,,
1,10077,Hi,Hello,,"Both 'Hi' and 'Hello' work as greetings in the sentence '___ there!'. They are common ways to say hello, matching the Korean '안녕하세요!'. 'Goodbye' would be incorrect because it doesn't match the greeting context.",,,
1,10078,Hi,Hello,,"Both 'Hi' and 'Hello' are appropriate greetings that fit naturally in the sentence “___, I'm Kim.”. They both match the Korean meaning ‘안녕’, which is used to greet someone. 'Bye' is not suitable as it means farewell, not greeting.",,,
1,10079,Nice,,,,,,
1,10080,marker,,,,,,
1,10081,Thanks,,,,,,
1,10082,Sit down,,,,,,
1,10083,I'm sorry,I apologize,,"Both 'I'm sorry' and 'I apologize' are suitable as they convey an apology, corresponding to '미안해요' in Korean. The response 'That's alright' from person B indicates that person A is apologizing. 'Excuse me' does not convey an apology and is inappropriate in this context.",,,
1,10084,a bird,,,,,,
1,10085,enormous,,,,,,
1,10086,Do you like cookies,,,"The Korean sentence '쿠키를 좋아하니?' translates directly to 'Do you like cookies?', where '좋아하다' means 'to like'. 'Do you eat cookies' and 'Do you make cookies' do not match the intended meaning of 'liking' cookies. Therefore, 'Do you like cookies' is the correct and only option.",,,
1,10087,like,,,,,,
1,10088,How many,,,,,,
1,10089,No,,,,,,

1,10098,tall,,,,,,
1,10099,red,,,,,,
1,10100,Observe,,,,,,
1,10101,rainy,,,"The Korean sentence '비가 와요' means 'It's raining.' Among the options provided, 'rainy' is the only one that correctly describes the rainy weather, making it the appropriate choice.",,,
1,10102,play,,,,,,
1,10103,Hi!,Howdy!,,"Both 'Hi!' and 'Howdy!' are used as greetings. In the sentence '___! How are you?', replacing the blank with either 'Hi!' or 'Howdy!' creates a natural greeting that fits the informal tone of the conversation. 'Bye!' is not appropriate because it is used for farewells.",,,
1,10104,I’m,,,,,,
1,10105,How,,,The phrase 'How are you?' is a common greeting in English corresponding to '어떻게 지내?' in Korean. 'What' and 'When' do not fit naturally in this context.,,,
1,10106,What's,,,,,,
1,10107,Good,Nice,Great,"All three options can naturally complete the phrase '___ work!' in a context of praising someone for a job well done, which corresponds to the Korean expression '잘 했어!'. 'Good work!', 'Nice work!', and 'Great work!' are all commonly used compliments in English, and thus each option could be considered correct.",,,
1,10108,Stand,,,,,,
1,10109,Thank you,,,,,,
1,10110,Two,,,,,,
1,10111,correct,,,,,,
1,10112,have,,,,,,
1,10113,have,,,"The sentence 'I don't have a ruler.' is the most natural and commonly used phrase to express that someone does not possess a ruler. Although 'own' means 'possess', it is less commonly used in this context, and 'take' does not fit grammatically or semantically.",,,
1,10114,blue,,,,,,
1,10115,I'm sorry,,,,,,
1,10116,bananas,,,"The Korean sentence directly translates to 'Do you like bananas?' Since the question specifically mentions 바나나 (banana) and 'bananas' is the only option that fits this context accurately, it is the correct answer. 'Cars' and 'computers' do not fit the context of the Korean sentence.",,,
1,10117,like,,,,,,
1,10118,huge,,,,,,
1,10119,cat,,,,,,
1,10120,jump,,,,,,
1,10121,swim,,,,,,

1,10123,strong,,,,,,
1,10124,How's,,,,,,
1,10125,Put,,,,,,
1,10126,Hello,Hi,Hey,"All three options are common greetings that can naturally fill the blank in the dialogue. The conversation involves informal greetings, and each option—'Hello', 'Hi', and 'Hey'—fits well in this context.",,,
1,10127,Hello,Bye,,"The Korean word '안녕' is versatile and can be used both as a greeting (hello) and as a farewell (bye). In this context, both 'Hello' and 'Bye' fit the usage of '안녕', while 'Good night' does not match the meaning.",,,
1,10128,I'm,,,"The contraction 'I'm' naturally fits the sentence, expressing 'I am Bella' in a grammatically correct manner, which aligns with the Korean sentence '나는 Bella야'. 'I do' and 'I been' do not convey the intended meaning.",,,
1,10129,this,,,,,,
1,10130,Look,,,,,,
1,10131,Sit,,,,,,
1,10132,I’m sorry,,,,,,
1,10133,oranges,,,,,,
1,10134,Great,Good,,"Both 'Great' and 'Good' appropriately capture the positive sentiment expressed by the Korean word '좋아!', meaning that something is favorable or good. 'Bad' contradicts this sentiment, so it is not a suitable choice.",,,
1,10135,ice cream,,,"The Korean sentence directly mentions '아이스크림', which corresponds to 'ice cream' in English. Therefore, this is the clear correct option.",,,
1,10136,like,,,,,,
1,10137,What,,,,,,
1,10138,Thank you,Thanks,,"Both 'Thank you' and 'Thanks' accurately convey the sentiment of 감사함 (gratitude) expressed in the Korean sentence. 'Thank you' is a full and formal expression of gratitude, while 'Thanks' is a more informal but commonly acceptable alternative. 'Thank', on the other hand, is incomplete and not used on its own to express thanks.",,,
1,10139,Is it,,,,,,
1,10140,tiny,small,,"Both 'small' and 'tiny' convey the meaning of 작아요. 'Small' is the direct translation, while 'tiny' is a synonym that also denotes a small size.",,,
1,10141,Do you have,Have you got,,"Both 'Do you have' and 'Have you got' are grammatically correct ways to ask if someone possesses a book, which matches the Korean sentence asking '책이 있니?'. 'Are you carrying' does not fit because it implies physical transportation rather than the state of owning or having a book.",,,
1,10142,have,,,,,,
1,10143,jump,,,,,,
1,10144,dance,,,,,,
1,10145,she,,,,,,

1,10149,this,,,,,,
1,10150,Look!,,,,,,
1,10151,Sit,,,,,,
1,10152,Great!,,,"The Korean sentence '대단해!' translates to an exclamation equivalent to 'Awesome!' or 'Great!'. 'Great!' conveys the same level of excitement and praise as the Korean expression. 'Good!' is a more subdued response and 'Bad!' does not match the positive meaning. Therefore, 'Great!' is the most suitable option.",,,
1,10153,tomatoes,,,,,,
1,10154,like,,,,,,
1,10155,cows,,,,,,
1,10156,massive,huge,,"Both 'massive' and 'huge' are adjectives that describe something very large, which aligns with the Korean phrase '엄청 커요' meaning 'very big' or 'enormous'. 'Tiny' is not suitable as it means very small.",,,
1,10157,dance,,,,,,
1,10158,can,,,,,,
1,10159,got,,,,,,
1,10160,Have you got,Do you have,,"Both 'Have you got' and 'Do you have' are acceptable in contexts asking about possession, especially in conversational English. 'Have you got an eraser?' is common in British English, while 'Do you have an eraser?' is widely used in American English. 'Did you have an eraser?' suggests a completed action in the past and does not fit the context of currently possessing an eraser.",,,
1,10161,have,,,,,,
1,10162,Here,,,,,,
1,10163,excited,,,,,,
1,10164,nervous,,,,,,
1,10165,I'm,,,,,,
1,10166,What color is,,,,,,
1,10167,Thanks so much!,Thanks a lot!,,"Both 'Thanks so much!' and 'Thanks a lot!' naturally serve as expressions of gratitude that match the Korean expression '정말 고마워요!'. They are commonly used in informal contexts to express thanks, and therefore, both options are suitable answers for this quiz.",,,
1,10168,brother,,,,,,
1,10169,friendly,,,,,,
1,10170,cloudy,,,,,,
1,10171,Let's go outside,,,,,,
1,10172,Hello,Hi,Hey,"All three options can naturally complete the greeting in the sentence. In English, phrases like 'Hello there!', 'Hi there!', and 'Hey there!' are commonly used informal greetings, and each accurately conveys the meaning of the Korean phrase '저기, 안녕!'. Thus, all options are acceptable answers.",,,
1,10173,I am,,,,,,
1,10174,What's,,,,,,
1,10175,See,,,,,,
1,10176,Sit down,,,,,,
1,10177,Thank you,,,,,,
1,10178,What's,,,,,,
1,10179,Look,,,"The command 'Look over here!' best captures the intended meaning of '여기 봐!' as a directive to direct one's attention. Although 'Watch' might also be used to indicate observing something, 'Look' is the more natural and commonly used imperative in this context. 'Listen' is not suitable, as it refers to hearing rather than visually noticing.",,,
1,10180,ice cream,,,,,,
1,10181,enjoy,like,,"Both 'enjoy' and 'like' can be used naturally in the sentence ""Do you ___ ice cream?"". 
 
 1. 'Enjoy' fits because it conveys a sense of having pleasure in eating ice cream, which aligns with the positive response given. 
 2. 'Like' is a common verb used when asking if someone is fond of something, which also perfectly matches the context of the conversation. 
 
 Thus, both options are correct choices.",,,
1,10182,How many lions,,,"Only 'How many lions' is correct because the question asks for the number of lions, and the answer given is about lions. The other options refer to bears and elephants, which do not match the answer sentence.",,,
1,10183,big,,,,,,
1,10184,Can,,,,,,
1,10185,play,,,,,,
1,10186,color,,,,,,
1,10187,I'm not sure,I don't know,,"Both 'I'm not sure' and 'I don't know' are appropriate responses when one is uncertain about an answer, as indicated by the context of the quiz and the Korean sentence. 'I'm sure' would contradict the intended meaning, so it is not a valid option.",,,
1,10188,backpack,,,,,,
1,10189,Here you go.,,,,,,
1,10190,How old,,,"The phrase 'How old' fits naturally in the context of asking someone’s age, which is the question in the quiz. 'What old' is not grammatically correct, and 'How many' is used for countable items rather than age.",,,
1,10191,Wishing,,,,,,
1,10192,She,,,,,,
1,10193,Good,Great,,"Both 'Good job!' and 'Great job!' are common expressions used to praise someone's performance, and they naturally correspond to the encouraging phrase '정말 잘했어!'.
 
 1. 'Good job!' is a familiar congratulatory remark.
 2. 'Great job!' is equally standard and often used to emphasize exceptional performance.
 
 The option 'Well job!' is not a typical expression in English for complimenting someone's work.",,,
1,10194,What's,How's,,"Both 'What's' and 'How's' fit naturally in the sentence. 'What's the weather?' is a common colloquial shortcut for 'What is the weather like?', while 'How's the weather?' is also a frequently used expression to inquire about weather conditions. 'Where's the weather?' is grammatically incorrect in this context.",,,
1,10195,eat,,,,,,
1,10196,Good day!,,,,,,
1,10197,Hello,Hey,,"Both 'Hello' and 'Hey' can be used as greetings that appropriately fill in the blank in the sentence. The Korean word '안녕' translates to a casual greeting, which aligns with both 'Hello' and 'Hey'. 'Goodbye' would be inappropriate in this context.",,,
1,10198,Thank you,,,,,,
1,10199,Hello,Goodbye,,"The Korean word '안녕' is used informally to mean both 'hello' when greeting someone and 'goodbye' when parting. Therefore, both 'Hello' and 'Goodbye' are acceptable translations in this context, while 'Welcome' is not aligned with the meaning of '안녕'.",,,
1,10200,this,,,,,,
1,10201,large,,,,,,
1,10202,Sit down,,,"The correct command informed by the Korean phrase '앉아 주세요' is to sit down, which directly matches the natural translation. 'Stand up' is the opposite command, and 'come here' does not match the instruction.",,,
1,10203,run,,,"The Korean phrase '뛰지 마' is best translated as 'don't run,' which directly matches with the option 'run'. Although 'jump' might be considered due to the dual meaning of 뛰다 in some contexts, in this sentence, 'run' is the more appropriate choice.",,,
1,10204,How many,,,,,,
1,10205,Look!,,,,,,
1,10206,strawberries,,,"The Korean sentence specifies 딸기, which directly translates to 'strawberry' or 'strawberries'. 'Apples' and 'oranges' do not match the Korean term, so 'strawberries' is the correct choice.",,,
1,10207,enjoy,,,,,,
1,10208,run fast,,,,,,
1,10209,Believe,,,,,,
1,10210,have,,,,,,

1,10216,weather,,,,,,
1,10217,play,,,,,,
1,10218,Hey,Hello,Hi,"All three options are common informal greetings that can naturally complete the sentence '______ there!'.
 
 1. 'Hey there!' is a casual and friendly greeting often used in informal contexts.
 2. 'Hello there!' is a slightly more formal but still common greeting that fits well here.
 3. 'Hi there!' is also a widely used greeting which matches the casual tone of the conversation.
 
 Thus, each option is acceptable as a greeting in this context.",,,
1,10219,is,,,,,,
1,10220,Thanks,,,,,,
1,10221,What's,,,,,,
1,10222,incredible,fantastic,amazing,"All three adjectives—'incredible', 'fantastic', and 'amazing'—express a similar sentiment of admiration or high praise, which aligns with the Korean expression '그거 정말 대단해!'. Each option can naturally complete the sentence ""That's ______!"" making any of them an acceptable answer.",,,
1,10223,Open,,,,,,
1,10224,I'm sorry,,,,,,
1,10225,apples,,,,,,

1,10228,like,,,,,,
1,10229,blue,,,,,,
1,10230,Look at,,,,,,
1,10231,Have you got,Do you have,,"Both 'Have you got' and 'Do you have' are common ways to ask about possession in casual conversation, and they fit naturally in the sentence format. 'Do you own' is less commonly used in everyday spoken English and can sound a bit formal or focused on ownership as a permanent state, which doesn't match the casual tone of the dialogue.",,,
1,10232,own,have,,"The sentence 'I ___ an eraser.' corresponds to the Korean '나는 지우개를 가지고 있어', which indicates possession. Both 'have' and 'own' serve to express possession.
 
 1. 'Have' is the standard, commonly used verb for possession in English and fits naturally with the subject 'I'.
 2. 'Own' also means to possess and is grammatically correct, although it is slightly less common in everyday speech for describing possession, it is still acceptable.
 3. 'Has' is incorrect because it does not agree with the subject 'I'.
 
 Thus, both 'have' and 'own' are valid options.",,,

1,10240,visit,,,,,,
1,10241,Hey,Hello,,"Both 'Hey' and 'Hello' are acceptable translations of the informal greeting '안녕'. In Korean, '안녕' can be used for both 'hi' and 'hello', making these two options fitting answers. 'Goodbye' does not match the greeting context.",,,
1,10242,I’m,,,,,,
1,10243,What’s,,,,,,
1,10244,What’s,,,,,,
1,10245,Check,,,,,,
1,10246,Raise,,,,,,
1,10247,Incredible,Awesome,Fantastic,"All three options are exclamatory adjectives that effectively capture the enthusiasm and admiration conveyed by the Korean expression '대단해!'. 'Incredible', 'Awesome', and 'Fantastic' can all be used to express a similar sentiment in English, making them equally viable choices for this quiz.",,,
1,10248,Do,,,,,,
1,10249,really,,,"The best option is 'really' because it naturally intensifies the statement 'I like rabbits.' without changing its meaning. 'Don't' would negate the sentence, and 'also' implies that someone else likes rabbits which is not indicated by the Korean sentence.",,,
1,10250,many,,,,,,

1,10262,Don't,,,,,,
1,10263,Watch,Look,,"Both 'Watch out!' and 'Look out!' are common phrases used to caution someone, matching the meaning of '조심해!'. Option 'See' does not form a common phrase in this context.",,,
1,10264,How,,,,,,
1,10265,Happy,,,,,,
1,10266,What's,How's,,"Both 'What's' and 'How's' appropriately fit the question '___ the weather?'.
 
 1. 'What's the weather?' is a common way of asking about current weather conditions and is grammatically natural in this context.
 2. 'How's the weather?' similarly asks about the weather, usually inquiring about its condition, which aligns well with the Korean sentence '날씨 어때?'.
 3. 'Tell me the weather?' is more of an imperative sentence than a question and does not match the natural question format used when asking '날씨 어때?'.
 
 Thus, both 'What's' and 'How's' are suitable choices.",,,
1,10267,Let’s,,,,,,
1,10268,Hi,Hello,,"Both 'Hi' and 'Hello' are common informal greetings that match the Korean expression '안녕!'. 'Hi' is a direct casual greeting, and 'Hello' is also used in casual contexts. 'Greetings' is more formal and less commonly used as an exclamation, so it is not the best fit.",,,
1,10269,Nice,Good,,"Both 'Nice' and 'Good' are commonly used in the greeting '___ to see you!' to express pleasure at meeting someone. 'Happy to see you!' is less common and does not naturally complete the greeting phrase. Thus, both 'Nice' and 'Good' are acceptable choices.",,,
1,10270,See you,,,The phrase 'See you later!' is a common farewell expression that corresponds well with the Korean '나중에 봐!'. The other options ('Meet you' and 'Talk you') do not naturally complete the expression or are not idiomatically used in this context.,,,
1,10271,Could you,Please,Would you,"All three options are acceptable ways to make a polite request in English that correspond to the Korean sentence '여기로 와 주세요.'
 
 1. 'Please' is the direct imperative form commonly used in requests, matching the structure and tone of the original sentence.
 2. 'Could you' turns the request into a polite question, which is also a natural way to ask someone to come.
 3. 'Would you' similarly offers a polite interrogative form.
 
 Since the blank can be filled by any of these forms to create a courteous request, all three are considered possible answers.",,,
1,10272,Thanks!,,,,,,
1,10273,What’s,,,,,,
1,10274,sorry,,,,,,
1,10275,apples,,,,,,
1,10276,I like,,,"The best option is 'I like' because the Korean sentence '바나나를 좋아해' translates to 'I like bananas.' The other options, 'I want' and 'I need', do not accurately convey the meaning of liking something.",,,
1,10277,ball,,,,,,
1,10278,cats,,,,,,
1,10279,How many,,,,,,
1,10280,It’s,This is,,"Both 'It’s heavy.' and 'This is heavy.' express that something is heavy. 'It’s heavy.' is a common, general statement of a state, whereas 'This is heavy.' is more specific, often used when referring directly to an object. 'They’re heavy.' implies a plural subject and doesn't match the singular '무거워요' in Korean.",,,

1,10282,Happy,,,,,,
1,10283,sad,,,,,,
1,10284,Are,,,,,,
1,10285,Can,,,,,,
1,10286,I can,They can,We can,"All three options can grammatically complete the sentence '___ run fast.' The Korean sentence '빠르게 달릴 수 있어.' is a general statement about the ability to run fast, and does not specify a subject. Therefore, 'I can', 'They can', and 'We can' are all acceptable answers depending on the context intended by the speaker.",,,
1,10287,What color,,,,,,
1,10288,That’s,This is,,"Both 'That’s correct.' and 'This is correct.' are natural responses in English to affirm correctness, matching the Korean '맞아요.' 'That’s correct.' is the most common way to affirm a statement, and 'This is correct.' can also be used for confirmation. 'It is correct.' is less typical in conversational contexts when simply agreeing.",,,
1,10289,How’s,,,"The phrase 'How’s the weather now?' is the most natural way to ask about the current condition of the weather in English. 'What’s' would typically be part of the phrase 'What's the weather like?', and 'Where’s' does not properly inquire about weather conditions.",,,
1,10290,Help,,,,,,
1,10291,My,,,,,,
1,10292,That,This,,"Both 'That' and 'This' can be contextually acceptable in the sentence ""___ is my brother."" The Korean sentence '이 사람은 내 형제야' translates directly to 'This is my brother', as '이' means 'this'. However, in English, when identifying someone who is not in the immediate proximity of the speaker, 'That is my brother' is also commonly used. Given that the sentence stands alone without additional context regarding proximity, both options are viable.",,,

1,10297,excited,,,,,,
1,10298,touch,,,,,,
1,10299,bag,,,,,,
1,10300,Where,,,The sentence is asking for the location of the phone. 'Where' is the correct interrogative to inquire about location. 'Who' and 'How' do not fit for asking about the position of an object.,,,
1,10301,What,,,,,,
1,10302,dinner,,,,,,
1,10303,pen,,,,,,
1,10304,black,,,,,,
1,10305,What,,,,,,
1,10306,pilot,,,,,,
1,10307,What are you doing?,,,"The correct answer is 'What are you doing?' because the question indicates an ongoing action, which matches the response 'I'm drawing.' The other options do not naturally fit the context, as 'What do you do?' typically refers to habitual behavior, and 'Why are you doing?' asks for a rationale.",,,
1,10308,reading,,,,,,
1,10309,this book,,,,,,
1,10310,exercise,,,,,,
1,10311,take a walk,,,"The Korean sentence indicates that the person takes a walk every day ('산책을 해요'), which corresponds to 'take a walk'. The other options do not match the meaning of the Korean sentence.",,,

1,10328,Can I stay here?,,,,,,
1,10329,proceed,,,"The sentence ""You may ___"" combined with the Korean ""계속 진행해도 됩니다."" indicates that the correct word should suggest continuing. 'Proceed' means to continue, which aligns perfectly with this meaning, whereas 'stop' and 'delay' do not match the intended message.",,,

1,10340,teacher,,,,,,
1,10341,Hello!,Hi,,"The Korean sentence '안녕하세요!' is a greeting, which translates into English as 'Hello!' or a casual 'Hi'.
 
 1. 'Hello!' is a direct and standard greeting equivalent of '안녕하세요!'.
 2. 'Hi' is an informal greeting that also fits the context perfectly.
 3. 'Goodbye!' is not a greeting and does not correspond to the Korean phrase.
 
 Thus, both 'Hello!' and 'Hi' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,10342,bag,,,,,,
1,10343,repeat,,,"The word 'repeat' naturally fits in the sentence 'Can you repeat that, please?' as it means to say something again. 'Redo' refers to doing something again and is more related to actions or tasks, while 'redraw' specifically means to draw again. Neither 'redo' nor 'redraw' align with the context of asking someone to say something again. Thus, 'repeat' is the correct answer.",,,
1,10344,thrilled,,,,,,
1,10345,feel,,,"The phrase 'feel down' is the common expression to indicate feeling depressed, which matches the Korean sentence '나는 우울해.' Although 'am down' might be occasionally heard, it is not as standard as 'feel down' in expressing one's mood. 'Get down' doesn't convey the intended meaning.",,,
1,10346,feeling,,,"The word 'feeling' is the correct fit for the sentence as it directly relates to one's physical state, which is the subject of the question about being well. 'Studying' and 'running' do not logically answer the question 'Are you ___ well?'.",,,
1,10347,What time,,,The phrase 'What time' fits perfectly in the sentence to ask about the current time. The other options either do not fit grammatically ('When time') or are used in different contexts ('How late').,,,
1,10348,school,,,,,,
1,10349,swimming,,,,,,
1,10350,Me,,,"Me, too' is the standard way to express agreement in this context, matching the Korean '나도 그래' (which literally means 'me too'). The other options ('You' and 'I') do not form a natural or grammatically correct response in English.",,,
1,10351,doing,,,,,,
1,10352,doing,,,"The word 'doing' fits naturally in the question 'What is your friend ___?' when asking about someone's current activity. 'Doing' is a general verb used to inquire about an action in progress, which aligns with the response 'She's watching television.' The other options ('playing' and 'sleeping') do not fit the context of the actual activity described.",,,
1,10353,want,,,,,,
1,10354,Would you like,,,"The phrase 'Would you like' fits the context of offering juice, especially given the politeness implied by the Korean sentence '주스를 드실래요?'. It is the most natural and grammatically appropriate option for a polite offer. 'Do you like' is inappropriate as it suggests a preference rather than an offer, and 'Will you have' is less commonly used in this context.",,,
1,10355,What,,,,,,
1,10356,awesome,,,,,,
1,10357,your bag,,,,,,
1,10358,Mine,,,,,,
1,10359,Stand,,,,,,
1,10360,support,assist,,"Both 'support' and 'assist' appropriately fill in the blank in the sentence ""Can you ____ me?"" as they both convey the meaning of giving help, which aligns with the Korean sentence asking for help. 'Ignore' is not appropriate because it has the opposite meaning.",,,
1,10361,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' can be used in the sentence 'Do you ___ swimming?' and are acceptable choices. 'Enjoy' directly corresponds to the Korean verb '즐기다' which is used in the question. However, 'like' is a common alternative when asking if someone appreciates an activity, making it a viable option as well. 'Watch' does not fit, as it implies observing rather than experiencing enjoyment.",,,
1,10362,enjoyable,,,,,,
1,10363,Good,,,,,,
1,10364,name,,,,,,
1,10365,How old,,,"The phrase 'How old' is the correct choice because it is the standard way to ask about someone's age. 'How many' is used for quantity and 'How tall' is used for height, which do not match the intended meaning of the question.",,,
1,10366,How,,,,,,
1,10367,buddy,,,,,,
1,10368,push,,,,,,
1,10369,Look,Watch,,"Both 'Look out!' and 'Watch out!' are common exclamatory phrases used to warn someone, matching the Korean phrase '조심해!'. 'Look out!' is widely used and directly fits, while 'Watch out!' is also a standard term for caution. 'Mind out!' is not a standard expression in this context.",,,

1,10378,That's,,,,,,
1,10379,your backpack,,,"The Korean sentence, ""이거 네 백팩이니?"", directly asks if the backpack belongs to the person being spoken to ('네' meaning 'your'). Thus, 'your backpack' is the only option that matches the intended meaning. 'His backpack' and 'my backpack' do not align with the possessive implied by the Korean question.",,,

1,10390,Good,Nice,,"Both 'Good' and 'Nice' naturally complete the sentence, creating common greetings such as 'Good to see you, too' and 'Nice to see you, too.' While 'Happy' could be understandable, it is less common and less idiomatic in this context.",,,
1,10391,morning,,,,,,
1,10392,happy,,,,,,

1,10394,sit,,,,,,
1,10395,Be careful,,,,,,
1,10396,play,,,,,,
1,10397,That's,,,"The phrase 'That's too bad' is a common expression used to convey sympathy or regret about an unfortunate situation. 'I am too bad' is grammatically incorrect in this context, and 'This is too bad' is less natural than 'That's too bad' for expressing empathy.",,,
1,10398,want,,,"The correct answer is 'want' because the sentence 'What do you ___?' corresponds to '무엇을 원해?' in Korean, which literally translates to 'want'. The other options ('need' and 'wish') do not match the meaning intended by the Korean sentence.",,,
1,10399,Serve yourself,Help yourself,,"Both 'Serve yourself' and 'Help yourself' are commonly used expressions in English to invite someone to take as much food or drink as they want, which aligns with the meaning of the Korean sentence '마음껏 드세요.'
 
 1. 'Help yourself' is a typical, idiomatic way to offer food, matching the polite invitation to eat freely.
 2. 'Serve yourself' conveys a similar meaning, implying that the person should take food at their own pace without waiting for assistance.
 3. 'Eat up' suggests a command to finish eating and doesn't capture the sense of self-service present in the Korean phrase.
 
 Therefore, both 'Serve yourself' and 'Help yourself' are acceptable answers.",,,

1,10411,Can I help you?,Shall I help you?,,"Both 'Can I help you?' and 'Shall I help you?' naturally match the polite offer conveyed in the Korean sentence '제가 도와드릴까요?'.
 
 1. 'Shall I help you?' directly translates the intention of offering assistance in a polite and tentative manner, which is a common way to offer help in English when corresponding to the Korean version.
 2. 'Can I help you?' is also commonly used for offering help, and while it slightly shifts the focus towards the ability to help, it still fits the context of offering assistance.
 
 'Do you need help?' on the other hand, asks if help is needed rather than offering to provide help, making it less suitable for this context.",,,

1,10414,How are you?,,,,,,
1,10415,Good,,,,,,
1,10416,This,,,"The sentence 'This is my friend.' is used to introduce a person, indicating that the friend is being presented or introduced, which fits the context of the quiz. 'That' generally refers to something more distant and 'Those' is plural, so they do not match the context as well as 'This'.",,,
1,10417,What’s your name?,,,"The phrase 'What’s your name?' correctly matches the Korean prompt asking for someone's name. 'Who are you?' would be more about identity, and 'When is your birthday?' completely changes the meaning, so 'What’s your name?' is the best option.",,,

1,10423,breakfast,,,"The sentence is referring to morning meal time as indicated by the Korean text '이제 아침식사 시간이에요,' which translates to 'It's now breakfast time.' The options 'dinner' and 'lunch' represent meals for other times of the day, making 'breakfast' the only appropriate choice.",,,
1,10424,your hat,your cap,,"Both 'your hat' and 'your cap' are acceptable answers because the original Korean sentence, '이것은 네 모자니?', means 'Is this your hat?' While 'hat' is the more direct translation of '모자', 'cap' is a similar type of headwear and is often used interchangeably in casual contexts. The option 'my cap' does not fit since it incorrectly attributes ownership.",,,

1,10435,assist me,help me,,"Both 'assist me' and 'help me' appropriately fit the sentence 'Can you ___?' in the context of asking for help. The Korean sentence '저 좀 도와줄 수 있어?' specifically asks for help, and while 'help me' is the most natural and commonly used phrase, 'assist me' is a formal synonym that also accurately conveys the intended meaning. 'Support me' is less appropriate because it typically implies providing emotional or logistical backing rather than direct help in this context.",,,
1,10436,Good,,,,,,
1,10437,What’s,,,"The sentence is asking for someone's name, and the correct expression in English is 'What’s your name?'. 'How's' may imply asking about someone's condition, and 'Where's' relates to location, so they do not fit the intended question. Thus, 'What’s' is the correct choice.",,,
1,10438,This,,,,,,
1,10439,run,,,,,,
1,10440,Be careful,,,"The phrase 'Be careful' is the standard idiomatic expression used to advise caution, especially in context of being on the road. 'Be carefully' is grammatically incorrect and 'Be feared' does not convey the intended warning.",,,
1,10441,cake,,,,,,
1,10442,want,,,,,,
1,10443,wallet,,,"The sentence's Korean version refers to '내 지갑', which means 'my wallet'. Therefore, 'wallet' is the only option that semantically and contextually fits the sentence, while 'book' and 'phone' do not match the intended object.",,,

1,10447,What time,,,,,,
1,10448,dinner,,,,,,
1,10449,What do you do?,,,"The phrase 'What do you do?' is appropriate because the Korean sentence '당신은 무슨 일을 하세요?' asks about one's occupation, and the response 'I’m a nurse' confirms that the question pertains to one's job. 'Where do you work?' and 'How are you?' do not match the intended meaning of asking about occupation.",,,
1,10450,does,,,,,,
1,10451,this,,,,,,
1,10452,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' can be used naturally in this sentence. 'Can I help you?' is a common phrase used to offer support, and 'Can I assist you?' is a more formal alternative that carries the same meaning. 'Serve' is less appropriate in this context since it's typically used in serviced contexts like in restaurants. Therefore, both 'assist' and 'help' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,10453,Friday,,,,,,
1,10454,certain,sure,,"Both 'certain' and 'sure' fit naturally in the conversation and convey the meaning of being confident or having no doubt, which aligns with the Korean sentence '너 확실해?'.
 
 1. 'Sure' is a common and natural response in informal conversation to confirm confidence.
 2. 'Certain' also correctly conveys the meaning of being sure or confident, though it may be slightly more formal.
 3. 'Ready' does not fit because it implies preparedness rather than certainty.
 
 Thus, both 'certain' and 'sure' are acceptable answers.",,,
1,10455,five,,,"The Korean sentence states that she is five years old, which directly matches the option 'five'. The other options do not align with the provided information.",,,

1,10462,occupied,busy,,"Both 'occupied' and 'busy' accurately capture the meaning of the Korean phrase '나는 바빠서', indicating that the speaker is not available due to being engaged in work or other activities. 'Occupied' is a bit more formal but still conveys the feeling of being busy, while 'busy' is the more common and direct translation. 'Free' is not appropriate as it means the opposite of being busy.",,,

1,10472,break,,,"The sentence 'It's time for a break.' correctly corresponds to the Korean '휴식할 시간이야', which implies it's time for a rest or pause. 'Nap' would imply sleep, and 'lunch' refers to a meal, making 'break' the best fit.",,,
1,10473,doing,,,,,,
1,10474,doing,,,,,,
1,10475,Friday,,,,,,
1,10476,pleasant,enjoyable,,"Both 'pleasant' and 'enjoyable' suitably fill in the blank to convey a positive wish for the evening. 'Have a pleasant evening!' is a very common, idiomatic expression in English, while 'Have an enjoyable evening!' is also acceptable though slightly less common. 'Successful' does not generally describe an evening in this context, as it typically refers to achieving success rather than simply having a good time.",,,
1,10477,What,,,,,,
1,10478,teacher,,,,,,
1,10479,this,,,"The Korean sentence '이 배낭은 얼마에요?' uses '이' which means 'this' in English. This indicates that the backpack being referred to is near the speaker. 'That' would be used if the backpack were farther away, and 'these' is grammatically incorrect because it is plural. Therefore, 'this' is the correct answer.",,,

 1. 'Making' directly translates the action of creating something, which fits the Korean sentence that describes crafting.
 2. 'Doing' is also acceptable when referring to engaging in a craft activity, as it implies participation in a craft project.
 3. 'Building' is less common with crafts and is usually reserved for constructing physical structures or models.

1,10504,How are you,What's up,,"Both 'How are you' and 'What's up' are common greetings used to ask about someone's well-being. In this context, the response 'I'm doing well' fits naturally as an answer to either greeting. 'Where are you' is a location-based question and does not match the provided response.",,,

'Put' is the most common phrase used to indicate the action of positioning something onto a surface, and 'Place' is also grammatically correct and semantically similar. 'Set' is generally used for arranging or adjusting items and doesn't fit the context as naturally as the other two.",,,
1,10511,nine,,,,,,
1,10512,lunch,,,The Korean sentence '이제 점심 시간이야' translates to 'It's time for lunch.' Only 'lunch' directly matches '점심'. 'Dinner' and 'breakfast' are incorrect as they refer to different mealtimes.,,,

1,10525,Nice,Glad,,"Both 'Nice' and 'Glad' can naturally complete the sentence '___ to meet you.' The phrase 'Nice to meet you' is a common and socially accepted expression in English, and 'Glad to meet you' is also used as an alternative with a similar meaning. 'Happy to meet you' is less common in this context, so it is not selected.",,,
1,10526,Are,,,The correct phrase is 'Are you okay?' since 'are' is the correct form of the verb 'to be' for the subject 'you'. 'Is' and 'am' do not grammatically match with 'you'.,,,

1,10542,Take,,,"The phrase 'Take as much as you like' fits naturally with the Korean instruction '원하는 만큼 드세요', which implies 'help yourself' to food or items. 'Make' and 'Leave' do not convey the intended meaning, while 'take' is commonly used in this context.",,,
1,10543,How,,,,,,
1,10544,I want,,,,,,
1,10545,What,,,"The sentence '___ do you do?' is asking about someone's occupation or activity, which is correctly completed by 'What do you do?'. The options 'Who' and 'Where' do not make sense in this context; 'Who' implies a person rather than an activity, and 'Where' refers to location.",,,

1,10548,Good evening!,,,,,,
1,10549,This,,,,,,
1,10550,What’s,,,The phrase 'What’s your friend’s name?' is the correct and standard way to ask for someone's name. 'How’s' and 'Where’s' do not semantically or grammatically fit the question.,,,
1,10551,Who,,,,,,
1,10552,She’s,He’s,They’re,"The Korean sentence '매우 똑똑해' means 'is very smart' without specifying gender or number. All three options create grammatically correct sentences depending on the intended subject:
 
 1. 'She’s very smart.' is correct if referring to a female.
 2. 'He’s very smart.' works if referring to a male.
 3. 'They’re very smart.' can be used as a plural form or a gender-neutral singular form depending on context.
 
 Thus, without additional context, any of the options can be considered correct.",,,
1,10553,Don’t,,,,,,
1,10554,Be,,,,,,
1,10555,Let's,Let us,,"Both 'Let's' and 'Let us' correctly convey the imperative suggestion '자전거를 타자' in English, meaning that it is an invitation to ride bikes. 'Let's' is common in informal contexts, while 'Let us' is more formal but still correct. 'Shall we' would change the sentence into a question rather than a direct suggestion, making it less appropriate for the given sentence.",,,

1,10575,use,borrow,,"Both 'use' and 'borrow' can be appropriate here. 
 
 1. 'Use' is a direct translation of 사용, which fits naturally into the sentence asking for permission to make use of someone's notebook. 
 2. 'Borrow' is also acceptable because it implies taking the notebook temporarily with the intention of returning it, which aligns with how someone might ask to use someone else’s notebook.
 3. 'Take' is not appropriate because it implies a permanent removal, which does not fit the intended meaning.",,,
1,10576,Okay,Sure,,"Both 'Okay' and 'Sure' are commonly used as casual affirmations in English and fit naturally in the sentence '___, no worries!'.
 1. 'Okay, no worries!' is a standard informal response implying agreement or acknowledgment.
 2. 'Sure, no worries!' also conveys a similar reassuring tone.
 
 'Yes, no worries!' is less common in this context, as 'Yes' typically affirms a statement rather than serving as a casual response like the other options.",,,

1,10585,What time,When,,"Both 'What time' and 'When' naturally complete the question to ask about the time someone wakes up. 'What time do you wake up?' is a common phrase used in English to inquire about a specific time, and 'When do you wake up?' conveys the same meaning in a more general form. 'Which time' is not typically used in this context, so it has been excluded.",,,
1,10586,meeting,,,,,,
1,10587,How much,,,"The correct answer is 'How much' because the question is asking about the price of the toy, as indicated by the Korean sentence '이 장난감은 얼마예요?' which translates to 'How much is this toy?'. 'How many' and 'What many' would be used for counting objects, not inquiring about cost.",,,
1,10588,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' fit the context of offering support when browsing for a book. 'May I help you?' is a very common phrasing in customer service, while 'May I assist you?' is also polite and grammatically correct. The option 'serve' is less natural in this context, as it typically implies a different type of service.",,,
1,10589,Where's,,,"The sentence is asking for the location of the nearest park, and 'Where's' is the contraction for 'Where is', making it the most suitable option. 'How's' would refer to condition and 'When's' would refer to time, which do not fit the context of asking about location.",,,
1,10590,one more time,,,"The phrase 'one more time' naturally fits the context of asking someone to repeat what they said, which is reflected in the Korean sentence. The other options 'in a minute' and 'right now' imply timing rather than repetition.",,,
1,10591,look like,,,,,,
1,10592,red,,,,,,
1,10593,do,,,,,,
1,10594,paints,draws,,"Both 'paints' and 'draws' can be acceptable translations of the Korean verb '그린다'.
 
 1. 'Draws' is the most direct and literal translation for creating pictures, as '그리다' commonly means to draw.
 2. 'Paints' can also be used because it describes creating beautiful pictures using paint, which is contextually appropriate even though the Korean sentence does not specify the medium.
 3. 'Builds' is not suitable as it refers to constructing something rather than creating a picture.
 
 Thus, both 'paints' and 'draws' are possible correct answers.",,,

1,10598,assist,,,,,,
1,10599,Whose,,,"The word 'Whose' is used to ask about possession, which fits the context where the bag belongs to someone, as indicated by the answer 'It's Donna's'. The other options do not logically ask about ownership.",,,
1,10600,Sarah's,,,"The sentence in Korean states that the pen belongs to Sarah. Among the options provided, only 'Sarah's' correctly indicates possession by Sarah, making it the appropriate choice.",,,

1,10607,wake up,get up,,"Both 'wake up' and 'get up' fit naturally in the question that asks about the time one rises in the morning. 'Wake up' directly matches the response, 'I wake up at 6:30,' while 'get up' is also commonly used to mean getting out of bed. 'Sleep' is not appropriate in this context since it refers to going to sleep rather than rising.",,,
1,10608,Good,,,,,,
1,10609,from,,,,,,
1,10610,pleasant,,,,,,
1,10611,went,,,"The correct answer is 'went' because the simple past tense of 'go' is required to match the Korean sentence '나는 공원에 갔어', which indicates a past action. The option 'walked' implies a specific mode of transportation (on foot), which is not explicitly stated in the Korean sentence, and 'go' is in the present tense, making them less appropriate choices.",,,

1,10618,Can I,May I,,"Both 'Can I' and 'May I' are acceptable ways to ask for permission in this context. 'Can I' is common in everyday language, while 'May I' is more formal and traditionally correct when asking for permission. 'Might I' is rarely used in modern spoken English and sounds awkward here.",,,
1,10619,library,,,,,,
1,10620,Thank you,Thanks,,"Both 'Thank you' and 'Thanks' are commonly used expressions of gratitude that fit naturally in the sentence '___ so much!'. 'Thank you so much!' and 'Thanks so much!' are both correct and widely acceptable. On the other hand, 'Thank' is not grammatically appropriate in this context because it is a verb that requires an object (e.g., 'thank someone').",,,
1,10621,paint,,,"The Korean sentence '나는 그림을 그려요' translates to 'I draw pictures,' which most naturally corresponds to the English verb 'paint' in this context. The other options ('cook' and 'sing') do not relate to drawing or creating art.",,,
1,10622,Amazing,Great,,"Both 'Amazing' and 'Great' naturally fit the sentence '_____ for you!' and convey the meaning of something really good happening for you, which aligns with the Korean sentence '너에게 정말 좋은 일이야.' While 'Cool for you' is understandable in a casual context, it is less idiomatic in this congratulatory expression compared to the other two options.",,,

1,10624,spell,,,,,,
1,10625,What are these?,,,,,,
1,10626,see,get,,"Both 'see' and 'get' are idiomatic expressions used to indicate understanding. 'Oh, I see' and 'Oh, I get it' are commonly used in English to mean 'I understood,' which corresponds with the Korean sentence '오, 이해했어.' The option 'know' does not fit because it does not imply the realization implied by the context.",,,
1,10627,May,Can,,"Both 'May' and 'Can' can be used to ask for permission in this context, although 'May' is more traditionally correct for polite permission while 'Can' is commonly used in everyday conversation. 'Will' does not fit the context of asking for permission.",,,
1,10628,welcome,,,,,,
1,10629,Whose,,,,,,
1,10630,large,,,,,,
1,10631,favorite,,,"The correct answer is 'favorite' because the question 'What's your favorite subject?' translates to asking which subject one likes best. 'Best' refers to quality rather than preference and doesn't align with the Korean version, and 'most' is grammatically incorrect in this context.",,,
1,10632,sketching,,,,,,
1,10633,get up,wake up,,"Both 'get up' and 'wake up' are used interchangeably in everyday English when referring to the act of leaving bed in the morning. While 'get up' more directly implies the action of rising from bed, 'wake up' naturally functions in the context of the question. 'Rise up' is not commonly used in this context, making it the unsuitable choice.",,,
1,10634,quite,very,,"Both 'quite' and 'very' are appropriate choices in this context. 'Very' is a direct expression of a high degree as translated in the Korean sentence (매우). 'Quite' also naturally intensifies the adjective 'early', making it a valid alternative. 'Somewhat' suggests a milder degree than intended and does not match the emphasis of '매우'.",,,
1,10635,will,,,,,,
1,10636,seems,,,,,,
1,10637,visited,,,,,,
1,10638,awesome,,,"The sentence is asking for a description of the trip, and based on the Korean sentence (여행은 어땠어? B: 정말 멋졌어), the intended meaning is that the trip was really great. 'Awesome' properly conveys the meaning of 멋졌어, whereas 'terrible' and 'normal' do not. Therefore, 'awesome' is the appropriate choice.",,,
1,10639,Go straight and turn left,,,"The Korean instruction translates to '계속 직진해서 좌회전해', which means 'Go straight and turn left'. This option best matches the directive provided. The other options do not reflect this meaning.",,,
1,10640,left,,,,,,
1,10641,How much,,,,,,
1,10642,May I,Can I,,"Both 'May I' and 'Can I' appropriately complete the sentence in a way that offers help. 'May I help you?' is a polite offer often used in service contexts, and 'Can I help you?' is a common, natural way to offer assistance. 'Should I help you?' is less natural in this context because it sounds more like seeking approval or wondering if help is needed rather than offering it.",,,

1,10660,Have a great trip,Enjoy your trip,,"Both 'Have a great trip' and 'Enjoy your trip' suitably convey the sentiment of '좋은 여행 되세요' in the Korean sentence, which is a wish for someone to have a good or enjoyable trip. Option 1 ('Have a safe flight') is inappropriate because it specifies a flight and does not match the context of '여행' (trip). Therefore, both Option 2 and Option 3 are viable answers.",,,

1,10672,feeling,,,,,,
1,10673,get,be,,"Both 'get' and 'be' work naturally in the sentence 'Don't ___ upset.'
 
 1. 'Don't get upset' is a common idiom used to advise someone not to become upset.
 2. 'Don't be upset' is equally common and instructs someone to remain calm rather than displaying upset feelings.
 
 The option 'feel' is less idiomatic in this context, which is why it is excluded.",,,
1,10674,bothering,troubling,,"Both 'bothering' and 'troubling' are commonly used to ask about someone's concerns or worries, which aligns well with the Korean sentence asking if the person has any worries. 'Bothering' is the most idiomatic option in this context, but 'troubling' also fits naturally. 'Annoying' is less appropriate because it more often refers to irritation caused by external factors rather than internal worries.",,,
1,10675,take,,,,,,
1,10676,read,,,,,,
1,10677,must,should,,"Both 'must' and 'should' can convey the sense of obligation expressed in the Korean sentence '너는 매일 운동해야 해.' The sentence implies that exercising every day is necessary. 'Must' indicates a strong obligation, while 'should' suggests a recommendation or moral obligation. 'Can' implies ability rather than obligation, so it does not fit in this context.",,,
1,10678,concert,,,,,,
1,10679,attend,join,,"Both 'attend' and 'join' can be used naturally in this context. 'Attend' is commonly used when referring to being present at an event such as an art exhibition, and 'join' can also imply participation in the event. 'Enter', however, is less suitable because it generally refers to going inside a place or contest, which does not fit the invitation context of an art exhibition.",,,
1,10680,will,,,,,,
1,10681,That's,,,"The contraction 'That's' (short for 'That is') is the most natural and idiomatic way to express agreement with a suggestion in English, which aligns with the enthusiastic tone of the Korean sentence '정말 훌륭한 아이디어야!'. Option 'This is' is less typical in such contexts and 'That was' incorrectly implies a past idea rather than a current proposal.",,,
1,10682,zoo,,,,,,
1,10683,beside,,,,,,
1,10684,Shall I take your order?,May I take your order?,Can I take your order?,"All three options can naturally be used when asking a customer if they are ready to order. 
 1. 'Shall I take your order?' is a polite, formal way of offering service and is common in scripted service dialogues.
 2. 'May I take your order?' is also very polite and is traditionally considered the most formal, especially in business or high-end service contexts.
 3. 'Can I take your order?' is acceptable in everyday conversation, even though it can be seen as slightly less formal, it still fits well in a service scenario.
 Thus, all three options are possible answers that fit the context of the quiz.",,,

1,10689,idea,clue,,"Both 'idea' and 'clue' are commonly used in the expression 'I have no idea' and 'I have no clue', which accurately translates the Korean sentence '나는 전혀 모른다.' into English. The word 'plan' does not fit because it does not convey the sense of not knowing something.",,,
1,10690,recycle,,,,,,
1,10691,Remember,Don't forget,,"Both 'Remember' and 'Don't forget' work well in this sentence when completed as 'Remember to turn off the TV' and 'Don't forget to turn off the TV'.
 1. 'Don't forget' is a direct translation of the Korean reminder, which means to not neglect the action.
 2. 'Remember' is also commonly used to give a reminder, and when phrased as 'Remember to turn off the TV', it conveys the same meaning.
 3. 'Try' does not fit because it suggests an attempt rather than a reminder.",,,

1,10698,favorite school subject,preferred subject,,"Both 'favorite school subject' and 'preferred subject' can correctly complete the sentence and align with the answer 'My favorite subject is art.'
 
 1. 'Favorite school subject' directly matches the idea of '가장 좋아하는 학교 과목' from the Korean sentence and clearly indicates the subject one likes best.
 2. 'Preferred subject' similarly implies a subject that is chosen or liked best, making it a plausible option in casual conversation.
 
 Thus, both options effectively convey the intended meaning.",,,
1,10699,like,,,,,,
1,10700,reusing paper bags,,,,,,
1,10701,Looks,,,"The Korean sentence '정말 좋아 보여' translates to 'really looks good', which directly corresponds with the phrase 'Looks great.' The other options ('Sounds' and 'Feels') do not align with the visual appearance described.",,,
1,10702,post office,,,,,,
1,10703,Pardon me!,Excuse me!,,"Both 'Pardon me!' and 'Excuse me!' are acceptable translations for '실례합니다!' used in situations where one is trying to get someone's attention politely or excuse oneself in a public setting. 'Sorry!' typically conveys an apology for a mistake, which is not the intended usage in this context.",,,

1,10711,Keep going,,,"The phrase 'Keep going' directly aligns with the encouragement '계속 나아가' in the Korean sentence, which means to continue onward. The other options, 'Stop now' and 'Turn back', are contrary to this supportive message.",,,
1,10712,prefer,,,"The sentence in Korean explicitly states '선호해', which directly translates to 'prefer'. Although 'like' and 'enjoy' are grammatically acceptable in English, 'prefer' is the most natural and accurate choice in this context given the specific meaning conveyed in the Korean prompt.",,,
1,10713,see,Catch,,"Both 'see you later' and 'Catch you later' are common informal ways to say goodbye, corresponding to the Korean phrase '나중에 봐요.' 'Look you later' does not form a natural expression, so it is excluded.",,,

1,10717,That's too bad,,,,,,
1,10718,When,,,"The question asks '___ is the meeting?' and the answer 'It's on March 15th.' specifies a time, making 'When' the appropriate word to fill in the blank. 'Who' and 'Where' would ask about a person or location, respectively, which do not match the answer.",,,
1,10719,Excuse me?,,,,,,
1,10720,planning,,,"The option 'planning' fits most naturally because the Korean sentence '오늘 오후에 무엇을 할 계획이니?' translates to asking about someone's plans for the afternoon. 'Planning' directly corresponds to having a plan or making an arrangement, which is why it is the best fit compared to 'thinking' or 'deciding'.",,,

1,10728,When,,,,,,
1,10729,looking forward,,,,,,
1,10730,about to,going to,,"Both 'about to' and 'going to' are suitable answers as they both indicate a future action and fit naturally into the sentence 'What are you ___ do?'. 'About to' means that the action is imminent, while 'going to' denotes a planned future action, matching the Korean sentence asking about what someone is going to do. 'Wanna' does not fit grammatically in this context.",,,
1,10731,great,,,"The expression 'Have a great day!' is the most common and idiomatic phrase in English, and it aligns well with the Korean adjective '멋진', which implies something splendid or wonderful. While 'good' and 'excellent' are positive, 'great' best captures the intended tone and meaning.",,,

1,10740,Have you heard,Do you know,,"Both 'Have you heard' and 'Do you know' work naturally in this context. 'Have you heard anything about folk tales?' is commonly used to inquire if someone has come across such stories, while 'Do you know anything about folk tales?' directly asks about the person's knowledge on the subject. 'Do you understand' is not appropriate here because it implies comprehension rather than mere awareness or familiarity.",,,
1,10741,don't know,,,,,,
1,10742,the zoo,,,,,,
1,10743,between,,,"The answer 'between' is the most appropriate because it denotes a location in the middle of two items, which matches the meaning of the Korean sentence indicating that it is located between the park and the school. 'Next to' and 'over' do not convey the idea of being in the space that divides two entities.",,,
1,10744,fascinating,,,,,,
1,10745,agree,,,,,,
1,10746,thrilled,,,"In this context, 'thrilled' best matches the Korean expression '들떠 있다,' which means being excited or in high spirits. The options 'sad' and 'tired' do not capture this meaning, especially given the positive explanation provided by B ('Because I performed well in the race').",,,

1,10750,What's,,,"The common expression 'What's the matter?' is used to ask what is wrong or what is happening. 'Where's the matter?' is grammatically incorrect and 'How's the matter?' is not a typical phrase in this context. Therefore, 'What's' is the only suitable answer.",,,

1,10754,library,,,,,,
1,10755,beside,next to,,"Both 'beside' and 'next to' naturally complete the sentence with the intended meaning, as they both indicate that something is located immediately adjacent to the park, which fits the Korean phrase '공원 옆에 있어.' 'Near' implies proximity but does not strictly mean 'right next to,' so it is less precise in this context.",,,

1,10758,look like,,,,,,
1,10759,wearing,,,,,,
1,10760,How frequently,How often,,Both 'How frequently' and 'How often' are acceptable in this context. 'How often' is the more common expression used in questions regarding the frequency of an action. 'How frequently' also accurately conveys the notion of frequency. 'How regularly' is less natural in everyday English for this context.,,,
1,10761,Great,Good,,"Both 'Great' and 'Good' are common exclamations used to express congratulations or approval, matching the meaning of the Korean phrase '잘 됐어!' which implies that something turned out well or is fortunate. 'Well' does not fit naturally as a standalone adjective in this context, making 'Great' and 'Good' the viable choices.",,,
1,10762,taller,,,,,,
1,10763,correct,,,,,,
1,10764,I think so,,,,,,
1,10765,I feel,I think,I believe,"All three options are plausible because they are commonly used in conversational English to express personal opinions. In the sentence 'A: ______ it’s challenging', each phrase—'I feel', 'I think', and 'I believe'—appropriately introduces a subjective judgment. The Korean sentence translates directly as '나는 이것이 도전적이라고 생각해', which literally means 'I think it's challenging', making 'I think' a straightforward match. However, 'I feel' and 'I believe' are also acceptable expressions that carry similar meanings when discussing one's perception or opinion about something. Thus, any of the three options could be duplicated as a correct answer.",,,
1,10766,Who,,,,,,
1,10767,Did you say,Did you mention,,"Both 'Did you say' and 'Did you mention' are acceptable in this context, as they are used to inquire about whether 'Shakespeare' was spoken. 
 1. 'Did you say' is the most direct way of asking if someone uttered a word or phrase, fitting naturally in this context. 
 2. 'Did you mention' conveys a similar meaning, as it also asks if the word was brought up in conversation. 
 3. 'Have you said' is less suitable due to its perfect tense, which is not as natural in this short, direct inquiry.",,,
1,10768,must,should,,"Both 'must' and 'should' can be used to indicate obligation in this context. 'Must' expresses a strong obligation, while 'should' is slightly less forceful, but in many everyday contexts, they can be used interchangeably when suggesting that something needs to be done. 'Could' expresses possibility rather than obligation, so it is not appropriate here.",,,

2,10006,Line up,,,"The phrase '줄을 서' in Korean translates to 'line up', which means to form a line or queue. 'Stand up' and 'sit down' do not convey the meaning of lining up, making 'Line up' the only appropriate option.",,,

2,10021,Hey,Hi,,"Both 'Hey' and 'Hi' are informal greetings that match the Korean '안녕!', which means 'hello!'. 'Bye' is excluded because it means farewell rather than a greeting.",,,
2,10022,Alex,,,,,,
2,10023,Catch you!,See you!,,"Both 'Catch you!' and 'See you!' work as informal farewells that appropriately convey the meaning of the Korean phrase '잘 가! 몸조심해.' While 'Later!' is also a farewell, it is less directly linked to the phrase 'Take care!' and does not fully match the tone of the quiz. Therefore, 'Catch you!' and 'See you!' are the best fits.",,,
2,10024,What's that?,,,,,,
2,10025,massive,,,"The word 'massive' best matches the Korean description of '거대합니다', meaning huge or enormous. 'Small' and 'little' convey the opposite of the intended meaning.",,,
2,10026,Take,,,,,,
2,10027,Amazing!,Super!,,"Both 'Amazing!' and 'Super!' capture the intended meaning of 굉장해, which is expressing something outstanding or impressive. 'Amazing!' directly translates to 굉장해, and 'Super!' is a close synonym. 'Cool!' does not match as accurately in conveying the full enthusiasm of the original Korean expression.",,,
2,10028,enjoy,,,,,,
2,10029,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' accurately convey the meaning of the Korean sentence, which translates to 'I like sushi.'
 1. 'Like' is the direct translation and is commonly used to express preference.
 2. 'Enjoy' also implies a positive feeling towards sushi and fits naturally in this sentence.
 3. 'Despise' is the opposite in meaning and is not appropriate.
 Thus, both 'like' and 'enjoy' are acceptable choices.",,,
2,10030,How have you been?,,,,,,
2,10031,Hello,,,"The Korean phrase '안녕하세요!' translates to a formal greeting in English. While 'Hey' and 'Hi' are also greetings, they tend to be more informal. 'Hello' is the most appropriate translation that fits the formality of the original Korean greeting.",,,
2,10032,ride,,,,,,
2,10033,able to,,,"The phrase 'able to' is the most appropriate choice in this context. The question 'Are you ___?' is asking about one's ability to do something, and 'able to' directly relates to having the ability. While 'capable of' also indicates ability, it is less commonly used in this construction without additional words (such as 'doing that'), and 'willing to' refers to one's readiness or inclination rather than capability.",,,
2,10034,dogs,,,,,,
2,10035,look,peek,,"Both 'look' and 'peek' are idiomatically used in the phrase 'Take a ___!' as invitations to observe or glance at something. 'Take a look!' is very common, and 'Take a peek!' is also used informally with the same meaning, fitting the Korean phrase '한번 봐!'. 'Glimpse' is less natural in this context.",,,

2,10042,What,,,"The sentence 'What is your age?' directly reflects the Korean question '너의 나이가 뭐니?' and fits naturally in the context of asking about someone's age, whereas the alternatives 'Where' and 'When' do not make sense in this context.",,,
2,10043,Congratulations,,,,,,
2,10044,Don't touch that,,,,,,
2,10045,Watch out,Look out,,"Both 'Watch out' and 'Look out' naturally express a warning, matching the Korean '주의해! 조심하십시오.' which instructs someone to be cautious. 'Hurry up' implies speed rather than caution, so it is not an appropriate choice.",,,
2,10046,sunny,,,,,,
2,10047,See you,Take care,,"Both 'See you' and 'Take care' are natural farewell expressions that fit the context of the conversation. 'See you' is commonly used as a casual goodbye meaning 'see you later'. 'Take care' also serves as a friendly farewell wishing someone well. Although 'Be well' is technically a farewell, it is less commonly used in casual conversation. Hence, both 'See you' and 'Take care' are acceptable answers.",,,
2,10048,See you!,Bye!,,"Both 'See you!' and 'Bye!' appropriately convey a farewell message in English, matching the Korean '안녕! 잘 가!' which is used for saying goodbye. 'Good night!' is not suitable here as it is commonly used for wishing someone a good sleep rather than to say farewell.",,,

2,10051,Check,,,,,,
2,10052,Bring,,,"The Korean sentence '펜을 가져와 주세요' directly translates to 'Bring the pen, please.' 'Bring' is the most natural and accurate command form in this context. 'Take' and 'Fetch' do not correspond as accurately to the intended action.",,,

2,10054,grapes,,,,,,
2,10055,like,,,,,,
2,10056,dislike,,,"Only 'dislike' correctly expresses the negative sentiment indicated by the Korean sentence '난 오렌지를 싫어해', which means 'I dislike oranges'. The other options 'like' and 'adore' express positive feelings, making them incorrect choices.",,,

2,10067,Pay attention,,,The phrase 'Pay attention when near the edge' conveys a warning that aligns with the Korean sentence '모서리 근처에 있을 때 주의하세요.' 'Focus on' does not naturally fit as an instruction for caution in this context and 'Ignore' is the opposite of what is intended.,,,

2,10073,How old are you,How many years old are you,,"Both 'How old are you' and 'How many years old are you' naturally ask about age in conversation. 'How old are you' is the most common, everyday phrasing, while 'How many years old are you' is also grammatically correct and can be used for emphasis on the numeric aspect. 'What's your age' is less commonly used in spoken English for such casual inquiries.",,,
2,10074,wonderful,,,"The option 'wonderful' logically fits the greeting phrase for a birthday. 'Many happy returns! Have a wonderful birthday!' is the standard well-wishing expressed in this phrase. The other options, 'bad' and 'dismal', have negative meanings and do not match the intended positive message.",,,
2,10075,weather,,,"The term 'weather' is the most appropriate option because the conversation is about the atmospheric conditions as indicated by the response 'It's sunny,' which directly relates to 날씨 (weather) in Korean. The other options do not fit this context.",,,

2,10077,Goodbye!,,,,,,
2,10078,Hello,,,,,,
2,10079,pleasure,,,"The phrase 'a pleasure to meet you' is the most natural and common expression in greetings. 'Joy' and 'happiness' do not fit naturally in this context, so 'pleasure' is the clear choice.",,,

2,10085,large,,,,,,
2,10086,Are you a fan of cookies,,,"The Korean sentence asks if someone is a fan of cookies, which directly corresponds to option_1 'Are you a fan of cookies'. Option_2 refers to cakes, and option_3 'Do you like cookies' does not capture the meaning of being a 'fan' as expressed in the Korean version.",,,

2,10090,draw,paint,write,"All of the provided options are verbs that indicate an ability to perform a particular action, which fits the structure of the sentence asking if someone is capable of doing something. The sentence 'Are you able to ___?' can be completed with any of these choices depending on the context or specific skill being discussed. Therefore, each option is a plausible answer.",,,
2,10091,able,,,,,,
2,10092,pencil,,,"The sentence in Korean asks if you own a pencil (연필), which directly matches option_2 'pencil'. The other options, 'notebook' and 'eraser', do not match the provided Korean translation.",,,
2,10093,have,,,,,,
2,10094,content,,,,,,
2,10095,Greetings,,,"The phrase 'Greetings on your birthday!' works as a warm, welcoming expression that aligns with the sentiment of the accompanying birthday wish. 'Congratulations' is typically reserved for achievements and milestones other than birthdays, and 'Sorry' is clearly not appropriate in this context. Thus, 'Greetings' is the best fit for this message.",,,

2,10104,I’m,My name is,,"Both 'I’m' and 'My name is' can accurately complete the sentence. 'I’m Anna.' is a natural way of introducing oneself, while 'My name is Anna.' is a direct translation of the Korean sentence '내 이름은 Anna야'. 'This is' does not fit contextually as it would typically be followed by another noun phrase rather than a name introduction.",,,

2,10126,Yo,Hey,,"Both 'Yo' and 'Hey' serve as informal interjections that naturally fit as greetings in the context of the conversation. The Korean expression '야!' can be translated into either 'Yo!' or 'Hey!', both of which match the casual tone of the exchange. 'Hi' is less suitable because it duplicates the greeting in B's response, making it less likely to be used as the initial exclamation.",,,
2,10127,See you!,,,,,,
2,10128,My name is,I am,,"Both 'My name is' and 'I am' can appropriately introduce someone in a self-introduction. The Korean sentence shows two natural ways of self-introduction: '내 이름은 예시예요' translates to 'My name is Example' (option 'My name is') and '나는 예시예요' translates to 'I am Example' (option 'I am'). 'I have' is not a natural fit in this context, so it is excluded.",,,
2,10129,pen,,,,,,
2,10130,Check,,,,,,
2,10131,Stand,,,,,,
2,10132,Sorry,,,"The phrase 'Sorry about that' is the most natural and common expression used in this context (casual apology). 'Apologize about that' is less common since 'apologize' is typically used with 'for' rather than 'about', and 'regret' does not convey the immediate casual apology intended in this conversation.",,,
2,10133,count,,,,,,
2,10134,Great,Good,,"Both 'Great job!' and 'Good job!' are common expressions used to praise someone for a job well done, matching the Korean phrase '아주 잘했어!'. 'Well job!' is not a natural expression in this context, so it is excluded.",,,

2,10141,Have you got,Do you have,,"Both 'Have you got' and 'Do you have' are grammatically correct ways to ask if someone possesses a pencil. In many varieties of English, especially in British English, 'Have you got' is commonly used, while 'Do you have' is standard in American English. 'Are you carrying' does not fit well because it implies physically holding or transporting the pencil rather than simply possessing it.",,,

2,10150,"Check this out! Hey, look over here!",See that! Look there!,,"Both 'Check this out! Hey, look over here!' and 'See that! Look there!' can be appropriate translations for the Korean sentence '이거 봐! 저기 봐!'.
 1. The phrase '이거 봐!' translates as 'Look at this!' or 'Check this out!', which is captured well by both options: option 1 explicitly as 'Check this out!' and option 2 with the implied direction to see something.
 2. The second part '저기 봐!' translates as 'Look over there!' or 'See that!', which is clearly matched by both options: 'Hey, look over here!' in option 1 and 'Look there!' in option 2.
 3. Option 3, 'Watch out! Over here!', implies a warning rather than simply drawing attention, making it unsuitable.
 Thus, both option 1 and option 2 are acceptable translations.",,,
2,10151,Stand,,,"In the context of the command '___ up, please.' with the Korean translation '일어나 주세요.' meaning 'please get up', the most fitting completion using the provided options is 'Stand'. 'Stand up' is the closest to conveying the idea of rising or getting out of bed, whereas 'Walk' does not match the intended meaning and 'Sleep' is contradictory.",,,
2,10152,Great!,Awesome!,,"Both 'Great!' and 'Awesome!' are enthusiastic exclamations that naturally complement the congratulatory remark 'Well done!' in the quiz sentence, matching the positive tone of the Korean phrase '멋져! 수고했어!'. 'Okay!' does not convey the same level of praise.",,,
2,10153,enjoy eating,,,,,,
2,10154,enjoy,,,,,,
2,10155,see,,,,,,
2,10156,huge,big,,"Both 'huge' and 'big' appropriately translate the Korean adjective '커요', which means large in size. 'Huge' and 'big' are synonyms in this context, and either can be used to express the intended meaning of a very large size, while 'small' contradicts the given description.",,,
2,10157,swim,,,,,,
2,10158,able,,,,,,
2,10159,going,,,"The phrase 'Keep going!' is a common phrase used to encourage someone to continue without giving up, which fits perfectly with the English idiom and the Korean meaning '계속해! 포기하지 마!'. 'Stopping' contradicts the intended meaning, and 'moving' is less idiomatic in this context.",,,
2,10160,Have you got,Do you have,,"Both 'Have you got' and 'Do you have' are acceptable ways to ask if someone possesses something.
 
 1. 'Do you have' is a common and straightforward construction for asking about possession in American English.
 2. 'Have you got' is frequently used in British English and is equally acceptable in spoken language.
 
 'Will you have' does not fit because it is not used to inquire about current possession but rather future events.",,,
2,10161,own,have,,"Both 'own' and 'have' express possession in English. The Korean sentence '나는 노트북을 소유해' means 'I possess a notebook', which can be directly translated as 'I own a notebook', but 'I have a notebook' is also a natural and acceptable way to express possession. 'Prefer' does not convey the meaning of possession, hence it is not a viable option.",,,
2,10162,coffee,,,,,,
2,10163,excited,,,"The correct answer is 'excited' because the Korean text '신나는' directly translates to feeling excited. The other options, 'tired' and 'bored', do not match the positive emotion expressed in the quiz.",,,
2,10164,excited,,,,,,
2,10165,apologies,,,,,,

2,10169,kind,,,,,,
2,10170,windy,,,,,,
2,10171,How about,Let's try,,"Both 'How about' and 'Let's try' effectively convey a suggestion, which fits the context of asking if someone wants to try a puzzle. 'How about' poses the idea as a question, while 'Let's try' implies a proposal to attempt it. On the other hand, 'Let's go' is typically used to indicate movement or starting an activity such as leaving, so it does not suit the context of starting a puzzle.",,,
2,10172,Hey,Hello,,"Both 'Hey' and 'Hello' are appropriate translations for '안녕!' as they are commonly used as casual greetings in English. The exclamation mark further emphasizes an informal greeting tone, making both 'Hey' and 'Hello' acceptable choices. 'Goodbye' is not appropriate since it has a completely opposite meaning.",,,
2,10173,I'm,,,,,,
2,10174,Lily,,,,,,
2,10175,Goodbye,Farewell,,"Both 'Goodbye' and 'Farewell' are appropriate for the blank as they serve as parting expressions that match the Korean meaning '당분간 안녕. 잘 지내.' 'Goodbye for now' is a common, casual farewell, while 'Farewell for now' offers a slightly more formal alternative. 'Hello' does not fit the intended context of a parting message.",,,
2,10176,take,,,,,,
2,10177,Thank you kindly,,,"The phrase 'Thank you kindly' matches the Korean '친절하게 감사합니다', which expresses gratitude in a courteous and friendly manner. 'Thank you thankfully' is awkward and not commonly used, and 'Thank you very much' does not capture the nuance of kindness implied in the Korean expression.",,,
2,10178,called,,,The word 'called' fits naturally in the question 'What is this called?' as it asks for the name of the object. 'Found' and 'needed' do not make sense in this context.,,,
2,10179,See,,,"The phrase 'See this! Pay attention!' aligns closely with the informal command in Korean '이것 좀 봐! 집중해!' where '봐' translates to 'look' or 'see.' Although 'Read' might seem plausible in a context involving written material, the Korean expression implies a directive to visually notice something rather than to read it. 'Ignore' is clearly contradictory to the instruction to pay attention.",,,
2,10180,fruit,,,,,,
2,10181,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Do you like ice cream?' is a common way of asking whether someone enjoys the taste or presence of ice cream, while 'Do you enjoy ice cream?' is another valid form that matches the response 'Yes, I enjoy it.' The option 'hate' contradicts the response and thus is not a possible answer.",,,
2,10182,five,,,,,,
2,10183,large,,,,,,
2,10184,Are you able to,,,"The sentence asks if you are capable of playing the guitar, which corresponds to the meaning of 'are you able to'.
 1. 'Do you need to' implies necessity rather than ability and does not match the Korean meaning, which is asking about skill or capability.
 2. 'Will you' implies a future action or willingness rather than ability.
 Thus, 'Are you able to' best fits the intended meaning.",,,
2,10185,dance,,,,,,
2,10186,tone,shade,,"Both 'tone' and 'shade' can be used to refer to variations in color. The Korean '색조' directly translates to 'tone', making it a suitable option, while 'shade' also fits naturally in the context of asking about color qualities. 'Taste' does not relate to color and is therefore not a viable option.",,,
2,10187,I have no idea,I'm not sure,,"Both 'I have no idea' and 'I'm not sure' are common responses when someone is uncertain about their opinion. 'I have no idea' directly expresses that one lacks an answer, while 'I'm not sure' indicates uncertainty. Although 'I can't say' could also be used, it is less direct regarding a lack of knowledge and might imply hesitation. Therefore, the most natural and commonly accepted responses in this context are 'I have no idea' and 'I'm not sure'.",,,
2,10188,backpack,,,,,,
2,10189,Here you go. There you go.,,,,,,
2,10190,seven,,,"The correct answer is 'seven' because the Korean sentence translates to 'I am seven years old', and '일곱' means 'seven'. The other options do not match the meaning of the Korean sentence.",,,
2,10191,fantastic,,,,,,
2,10192,He,,,,,,
2,10193,Excellent,,,"The Korean sentence '훌륭한 노력이다!' directly translates to 'Excellent effort!', which matches the option 'Excellent'. The other options, 'Mediocre' and 'Average', do not convey the same positive connotation as the Korean phrase.",,,
2,10194,clear,,,,,,
2,10195,play,,,,,,
2,10196,How are you? Hi there!,,,"Option 2 is the best match because the Korean sentence '어떻게 지내? 안녕!' directly translates to 'How are you? Hi there!'. This informal greeting fits the context of the conversation perfectly, whereas the other options either use more formal language or a different casual greeting.",,,

2,10204,see,,,"The word 'see' directly corresponds to the Korean phrase '보고 있니?' which means 'are you looking at' or 'seeing'. The other options, 'find' and 'hear', do not accurately capture the intended meaning of visual perception described in the Korean sentence.",,,
2,10205,check this out,,,,,,
2,10206,strawberries,,,"The Korean sentence specifically asks about enjoying eating strawberries ('딸기'), and among the given options, only 'strawberries' directly corresponds to the Korean term. 'Bananas' and 'grapes' do not match the Korean meaning.",,,

2,10208,swim,,,,,,
2,10209,success,,,,,,
2,10210,have,,,"The word 'have' is the most natural and common choice in conversational English when asking someone if they possess or own something. While 'possess' and 'own' have similar meanings, they sound formal and less idiomatic in this context.",,,
2,10211,own,have,,"Both 'own' and 'have' can be used in this context. 'Have' is the common expression for possession in English, matching the Korean sentence asking if someone possesses a bag. 'Own' also fits because it directly inquires about possession. 'Get' is inappropriate as it implies acquiring rather than possessing.",,,

2,10218,Goodbye,Take care,,"Both 'Goodbye' and 'Take care' are common farewell expressions that appropriately match the casual tone of the conversation. 'Goodbye' aligns with the typical farewell expression, while 'Take care' is also widely used when saying farewell among friends. 'Be safe' is less common in this context, making it a less likely option.",,,

2,10222,great,wonderful,awesome,"All three adjectives can naturally complete the exclamatory sentence 'That's ______! It feels incredible!'.
 1. 'Great' is a common exclamation to express admiration or excitement.
 2. 'Wonderful' similarly conveys a sense of marvel or admiration.
 3. 'Awesome' fits especially well as it directly translates to '멋져' in Korean and carries a strong positive connotation.
 Therefore, each option could be considered correct in this context.",,,
2,10223,Bring,,,,,,
2,10224,I apologize.,,,,,,
2,10225,six,five,four,"The quiz provides only a blank for a number to answer the question 'How many oranges are there?' in Korean ('오렌지 몇 개야?'). Without additional context such as an image or further details, any of the numerical options (six, five, or four) could logically complete the sentence. Therefore, all three options are considered possible answers.",,,
2,10226,Thanks. Many thanks to you.,,,,,,
2,10227,enjoy,,,,,,
2,10228,like,enjoy,,"Both 'like' and 'enjoy' fit grammatically and semantically in the sentence 'I ___ sushi.' The Korean sentence '나는 초밥을 즐겨.' can be translated as either 'I enjoy sushi.' or 'I like sushi.' Since both words convey a sense of positive feeling towards sushi, they are both valid answers.",,,
2,10229,red,,,,,,
2,10230,Observe,,,,,,
2,10231,possess,own,,"Both 'possess' and 'own' are grammatically correct and semantically appropriate for the sentence. 'Possess' is a formal term for having something, which fits the sentence, while 'own' is more commonly used in everyday language to ask if someone has something. 'Use' does not answer the question of ownership, so it is not appropriate.",,,

2,10235,big,huge,,"Both 'big' and 'huge' convey the sense of something that is large, which aligns with the Korean term '거대하다'. 'Huge' may be considered slightly stronger in meaning, but 'big' is also acceptable. 'Tiny' is not suitable as it implies something very small.",,,

The other options 'Poor' and 'Bad' have negative connotations and do not match the positive meaning.",,,

2,10260,he,,,,,,
2,10261,looks,,,"The sentence 'She ___ strong.' when translated from '그녀는 힘이 세 보여요.' fits best with 'looks' since the Korean implies that she appears strong rather than asserting a fact. 'Is' would mean she is definitively strong, which does not capture the nuance of '보여요' (appears), and 'be' is grammatically incorrect in this context.",,,
2,10262,Watch,,,,,,
2,10263,Be,,,"The correct command form in English is 'Be careful!', which is an imperative sentence. 'Becoming' and 'Being' do not form a grammatically correct command in this context.",,,
2,10264,he,,,,,,
2,10265,birthday,,,"The phrase 'happy birthday' is a common greeting, and the Korean sentence specifically wishes someone a happy birthday. 'Monday' and 'ending' do not fit the context, as they do not form a conventional or logical greeting.",,,
2,10266,sunny,,,,,,
2,10267,How,,,,,,
2,10268,Nice,Great,,"Both 'Nice to meet you!' and 'Great to meet you!' are commonly used as greetings. 'Nice to meet you!' is the most standard and widely accepted phrase, while 'Great to meet you!' is also natural and conveys a similar friendly sentiment. 'Lovely to meet you!' is less frequently used in casual greetings, making it a less suitable option.",,,
2,10269,meet,,,,,,
2,10270,nice,,,,,,
2,10271,sit,,,,,,
2,10272,it,you,,"Both 'it' and 'you' can fit naturally in the sentence 'I really appreciate ___.'.
 
 1. 'I really appreciate it' is a common, idiomatic expression used to express gratitude, where 'it' refers to a favor or act of kindness, which aligns with the general meaning of 감사함 in the Korean sentence.
 2. 'I really appreciate you' is also used, especially to convey personal gratitude towards someone, making the expression more direct and personal.
 
 Option 'them' is less fitting because the context does not suggest a plural referent.",,,

2,10280,It’s,This is,,"Both 'It’s' and 'This is' can suitably complete the sentence, depending on context. 'It’s very tall.' is used in a general sense to describe a singular object, while 'This is very tall.' may be used when directly indicating a specific object that is near. 'They are very tall.' is inconsistent with the singular context provided in the quiz and Korean sentence.",,,
2,10281,How old,,,"The correct phrase 'How old' fits grammatically with the question asking about the age of the cat. 'How much' generally refers to quantity or price, and 'How long' refers to duration, so they do not match the intended meaning of the inquiry.",,,
2,10282,great,,,,,,
2,10283,nervous,,,"The Korean sentence '나는 긴장돼' translates to 'I’m nervous' in English. 'Bored' means 지루해 and 'confident' means 자신감 있어, neither of which match the Korean meaning. Thus, 'nervous' is the correct answer.",,,

2,10287,What color,,,"The Korean question asks about the color of the bag ('무슨 색'), so 'What color' is the most appropriate option. 'What type' and 'What brand' do not match the meaning.",,,

2,10291,call,,,,,,
2,10292,present,introduce,,"Both 'introduce' and 'present' are acceptable in this context. 'Introduce' is the standard term for acquainting someone with another person, which fits well with the Korean phrase '내 친구를 소개할게.' 'Present' can also be used to mean 'to introduce someone' in formal contexts. 'Announce' does not convey the act of introducing a person, so it is not appropriate here.",,,
2,10293,meet,,,,,,
2,10294,soccer,,,"The Korean sentence indicates a suggestion to play soccer ('축구하자고 제안해봐'), which directly matches the option 'soccer'. 'Cooking' and 'reading' do not fit the context.",,,

2,10296,happy,,,,,,
2,10297,happy,,,,,,
2,10298,touch,,,"The sentence 'Please don't ___.' combined with the Korean translation '제발 만지지 마세요.' indicates that the intended word is 'touch', which corresponds directly to the action of touching. 'Feel' and 'smell' do not match the Korean meaning.",,,
2,10299,bag,,,,,,
2,10300,next to,,,,,,
2,10301,ten fifteen,quarter past ten,,"Both 'ten fifteen' and 'quarter past ten' correctly represent the time 10:15, which is given in the Korean sentence as 십시 십오분.
 
 1. 'ten fifteen' directly denotes 10:15.
 2. 'quarter past ten' is an equivalent expression for 10:15.
 
 Thus, both options are correct.",,,

2,10307,What are you doing?,What are you up to?,,"Both 'What are you doing?' and 'What are you up to?' are valid translations for the Korean sentence '뭐 하고 있어?'. 'What are you doing?' is the more standard and direct translation, while 'What are you up to?' is an informal synonym that conveys the same meaning. 'Where are you going?' does not match the context of the activity (reading).",,,

2,10326,care,,,"The phrase 'care for' is an idiomatic expression used when offering something to someone, as in 'Would you care for some soup?' This usage aligns with the given Korean sentence, which is a polite offer. 'Need' does not fit because the correct formulation would be 'Do you need some soup?' without the 'for', and 'seek' does not make sense in this context.",,,
2,10327,Help yourself,,,"In the sentence, the phrase that best fits is 'Help yourself' because it conveys the idea of eating snacks freely, matching the Korean sentence '마음껏 간식을 먹어봐', which invites someone to help themselves. 'Try out' suggests testing something, and 'Indulge' implies going overboard, neither of which perfectly align with the casual, inviting tone of the original sentence.",,,
2,10328,Can I sit down here?,May I sit down here?,,"Both 'Can I sit down here?' and 'May I sit down here?' are acceptable options for asking permission to sit down in a polite conversation. 
 
 1. 'Can I sit down here?' is commonly used in everyday informal or semi-formal contexts to ask for permission. 
 2. 'May I sit down here?' is a more formal alternative that directly requests permission. 
 
 'Should I sit down here?' is not appropriate because it implies asking for advice rather than permission. Therefore, the two possible correct answers are 'Can I sit down here?' and 'May I sit down here?'.",,,
2,10329,leave,go,,"Both 'leave' and 'go' can be valid translations for the Korean sentence '자유롭게 가셔도 됩니다.'
 
 1. 'Feel free to leave' is a common expression used to indicate that someone may depart at their convenience.
 2. 'Feel free to go' is also idiomatic and directly translates to '가셔도 됩니다,' meaning that the person is free to go.
 
 Option 'stop' is not suitable in this context because it does not convey the idea of departing.",,,

2,10339,good,,,"The sentence 'I'm feeling ____.' when paired with the Korean '기분이 좋아' clearly indicates that the intended meaning is a positive state. 'Good' directly translates to '좋아' in this context, making it the most appropriate choice. 'Fine' might indicate being okay but is less directly aligned with the expression '기분이 좋아', and 'bad' is clearly incorrect.",,,
2,10340,neighbor,,,,,,
2,10341,How do you do?,,,"The sentence 'It's great to meet you!' is a formal introduction, and 'How do you do?' is a conventional response in formal greetings. 'What's up?' is too informal, and 'See you later?' is used for farewells, making 'How do you do?' the appropriate choice.",,,
2,10342,door,,,"The Korean sentence states that the phone is near the '문', which translates to 'door'. Option 'door' directly corresponds to this, making it the most suitable choice.",,,
2,10343,say,,,,,,
2,10344,excited,,,,,,
2,10345,blue,,,"The phrase 'feeling blue' is an idiom that means feeling sad or depressed, which matches the Korean sentence '나는 우울해.' 'Red' and 'green' do not have this idiomatic meaning in this context.",,,

2,10353,want,,,,,,
2,10354,Do you want,Would you like,,"Both 'Do you want' and 'Would you like' are grammatically correct and appropriate for making an offer of cake. In the context of the question, either phrase fits naturally:
 
 1. 'Do you want' is a direct way to ask someone if they desire some cake.
 2. 'Would you like' is a more polite form commonly used in offers, and it closely corresponds with the Korean phrasing (드실래요).
 
 Therefore, both options are acceptable answers.",,,
2,10355,Wednesday,,,,,,
2,10356,fantastic,,,"The word 'fantastic' best fits the exclamatory nature of the sentence and matches the enthusiastic meaning of the Korean phrase, which implies something extraordinary and wonderful. 'Ordinary' and 'dismal' have opposite meanings.",,,
2,10357,item,thing,,Both 'item' and 'thing' appropriately translate the Korean word '물건' in the context of the sentence. They are logical and grammatically suitable answers for the blank in the question 'Is ___ yours?'. 'Bag' is too specific and does not match the generic meaning intended by the Korean sentence.,,,

2,10360,help,,,,,,
2,10361,hiking,,,"The Korean sentence indicates that the speaker enjoys hiking (등산을 즐겨). Among the options, 'hiking' directly corresponds to this activity, making it the correct answer. 'Cooking' and 'singing' do not match the meaning expressed by the Korean sentence.",,,

2,10363,afternoon,,,,,,
2,10364,name,,,,,,
2,10365,What's,,,"The option 'What's' fits naturally into the question, 'What is your age?', which is a common way to ask for someone's age. 'How's' would usually be part of 'How is your age?' which doesn't make sense in this context, and 'When's' typically refers to time questions and doesn't work with age.",,,

2,10368,push,,,,,,
2,10369,attention,,,"The phrase 'pay attention' is the standard expression used to mean '주의하세요.' 'Care' does not naturally follow 'pay' in this context and 'caution' is not correctly used with 'pay'. Therefore, only 'attention' is the appropriate choice.",,,

2,10387,swimming,,,"The Korean sentence specifies that the person likes swimming (수영) on weekends. 'Swimming' is the correct answer as it directly translates the Korean word and fits logically into the blank, while 'cooking' and 'reading' do not match the meaning.",,,
2,10388,yourself,,,,,,
2,10389,May I know,Can I ask,,"Both 'May I know' and 'Can I ask' are acceptable ways to politely inquire about someone’s name in English. 'May I know your name?' is a formal way of asking, while 'Can I ask your name?' is slightly less formal but still correct. 'Will I know your name?' is grammatically incorrect and does not fit the context.",,,
2,10390,Glad,,,,,,
2,10391,afternoon,,,The Korean text translates to 'Good afternoon! Good evening!' so 'afternoon' correctly fills the blank to match the first greeting.,,,
2,10392,feeling,,,"The correct answer is 'feeling' because the expression ""Are you feeling?"" is commonly used to ask about someone's emotional state. In contrast, 'seeing' and 'doing' do not appropriately refer to one's emotional state.",,,

2,10394,talk,,,,,,
2,10395,Watch out,,,,,,
2,10396,try,,,"The Korean expression '한 번 해보자' directly translates to 'let's try something', which makes 'try' the appropriate choice. 'Do' and 'buy' do not adequately reflect the intended meaning of '해보다' in this context.",,,
2,10397,sorry,,,The sentence 'I'm ___ to hear that' paired with the Korean '듣게 되어 유감이야' expresses regret. 'Sorry' fits naturally as it conveys regret. 'Happy' and 'excited' do not match the sentiment of regret.,,,
2,10398,book,,,,,,
2,10399,take some,,,,,,
2,10400,under,,,"The sentence indicates the cap is located in a specific position relative to the table. The Korean sentence '탁자 아래에 있어' directly translates to 'under the table', which clearly supports the answer 'under'. Neither 'over' nor 'beside' match the description provided in the Korean sentence.",,,
2,10401,sure,,,,,,
2,10402,Thursday,,,,,,
2,10403,next,,,"The Korean sentence '내 다음 수업은 Math야' translates directly to 'My next class is Math.' Among the options, 'next' precisely matches the meaning of '다음'. Although 'upcoming' also indicates a future class, 'next class' is the natural and common expression in English, making it the best fit. 'Last' is out of context as it refers to a previous class.",,,

2,10405,buy,,,,,,
2,10406,belong,,,,,,
2,10407,blue,,,,,,
2,10408,ten thirty,,,The correct answer is 'ten thirty' because it directly corresponds to the Korean time '10시 30분.' 'Quarter past' and 'half past' refer to times that do not match the specific time given.,,,
2,10409,lunch,,,,,,
2,10410,What are you working on?,,,,,,
2,10411,May I assist you?,Could I help you?,,Both 'May I assist you?' and 'Could I help you?' are appropriate translations of '제가 도와드릴까요?' and naturally convey offering help in a polite manner. 'Do you require help?' is more of a literal inquiry about needing help and does not capture the courteous offer as effectively.,,,

2,10422,Do you know what time it is?,What time is it now?,,"Both 'Do you know what time it is?' and 'What time is it now?' correctly correspond to the Korean question asking for the time. 'Do you know what time it is?' is a common introductory question asking for time, while 'What time is it now?' is a direct inquiry. Option 3, 'How old are you?', is irrelevant to asking the time.",,,

2,10437,May I know,,,"The phrase 'May I know your name?' is the appropriate and polite way to inquire about someone's name, matching the Korean sentence which asks for someone's name. 'Do I know' does not make sense in the context of asking for someone's name, and 'Could you know' is grammatically incorrect for this purpose.",,,
2,10438,introduce,,,,,,
2,10439,shout,,,,,,
2,10440,Watch,Look,,"Both 'Watch out!' and 'Look out!' are commonly used expressions to alert someone to be careful and stay alert, which aligns with the Korean instruction '조심해! 경계하세요!'.
 
 1. 'Watch out!' is a frequently used phrase to warn someone to be cautious.
 2. 'Look out!' is also widely used with the same meaning.
 
 Thus, both options are acceptable in this context.",,,
2,10441,cookie,,,,,,
2,10442,like,love,,"Both 'like' and 'love' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Like' directly corresponds to the Korean phrase '나는 주스를 좋아해', making it a straightforward translation and a common way to express a preference in a polite request. At the same time, 'love' is also frequently used colloquially to express a strong, positive desire when requesting something, as in 'I'd love some juice.' The option 'want' is less appropriate because it tends to indicate a more forceful desire and is less commonly used in polite requests.",,,
2,10443,shelf,,,"The word 'shelf' is the correct answer because the Korean word '선반' translates directly to 'shelf'. 'Desk' does not match because it refers to furniture used for writing, and 'carpet' does not match because it is a floor covering.",,,

2,10455,five,,,,,,
2,10456,Sorry to interrupt.,Pardon me.,,"Both 'Sorry to interrupt.' and 'Pardon me.' are commonly used phrases when interrupting a conversation, which matches the Korean description. The phrase 'Pardon me.' already appears at the beginning, so using it again is acceptable, although many speakers might choose 'Sorry to interrupt.' to vary the expression. 'Never mind.' does not fit the context, making the first two the valid choices.",,,

2,10460,Mrs. Lee,Mr. Brown,Ms. Carter,"Each option is a plausible teacher's name and the sentence 'This is my teacher, ___.' simply introduces the teacher without specifying any gender or title constraints based on context.

2,10470,small,,,,,,
2,10471,ten o'clock,nine o'clock,eight o'clock,"All three options are valid responses to the question 'Can you tell me the time?' because the sentence 'It's ___' can logically be completed with any specific time. The Korean prompt simply indicates that the sentence is related to asking and telling time, without a context to narrow down the specific time. Therefore, each option—'ten o'clock', 'nine o'clock', and 'eight o'clock'—could correctly complete the sentence.",,,

'Funny' does not fit this description as it refers to a sense of humor rather than a kind or warm demeanor. Therefore, both 'friendly' and 'kind' are acceptable answers.",,,
2,10485,six,,,,,,
2,10486,breakfast,,,,,,
2,10487,biking,,,The answer 'biking' is the most appropriate because the Korean sentence implies going cycling (자전거 타러 갈까). 'Running' and 'swimming' are different activities that do not match the intended cycling activity.,,,
2,10488,feeling,doing,,"Both 'feeling' and 'doing' fit naturally in the sentence. 'Are you feeling fine?' is the more standard form to describe one's physical or emotional state, as reflected in the Korean sentence asking about someone's condition. 'Are you doing fine?' is also acceptable in casual conversation, as it is similar to asking 'How are you doing?'. 'Being' does not naturally fit in the context.",,,
2,10489,counter,,,,,,
2,10490,restate,rephrase,,"Both 'restate' and 'rephrase' fit naturally in the context of asking someone to explain what they just mentioned using different words. The sentence is asking for a rewording of the statement, and both options convey that meaning clearly. On the other hand, 'reinterpret' implies offering a new or different interpretation rather than simply rewording, making it less appropriate in this context.",,,

2,10506,So,,,"The phrase 'So do I' is the commonly accepted way to express agreement in English, aligning with the Korean '나도 그래.' This makes 'So' the most natural and grammatically correct choice out of the given options.",,,

2,10508,That's so unfortunate.,,,,,,
2,10509,touch,,,,,,
2,10510,Place,Put,,"Both 'Place' and 'Put' are correct as commands to position something in a particular location, which aligns with the Korean instruction '꽃을 탁자 위에 놓아.' 'Arrange' implies organizing or ordering elements, which does not match the simple action of placing a flower on the table.",,,

2,10526,good,well,,"Both 'good' and 'well' can fit naturally in the sentence depending on the intended meaning. 'Good' is typically used to describe one’s mood and aligns directly with the Korean sentence asking if one is in a positive state of mind, while 'well' is also used to ask about one's overall condition or health. Given that the context can be interpreted in terms of mood or health, both answers are acceptable.",,,
2,10527,happy,,,,,,
2,10528,bag,,,,,,
2,10529,cloth,,,"The Korean sentence '이것은 옷이야' translates to 'This is clothes' or 'This is clothing', and among the given options, 'cloth' is the one that is related to clothing. Neither 'car' nor 'shoes' correspond to the Korean meaning.",,,
2,10530,on,,,"The sentence is indicating the placement of an object on top of the table. 'On' is the natural choice in this context since it means placing something on the surface. 'Under' would imply beneath the table, and 'between' would require a reference to two objects.",,,

2,10537,What time is,,,"The Korean phrase '몇 시야?' translates to 'What time is it?' in English. Among the options provided, 'What time is' correctly matches the meaning of asking for the current time, whereas 'What day is' and 'What month is' refer to a day or a month, respectively.",,,
2,10538,It’s,,,,,,
2,10539,drawing,painting,,"Both 'drawing' and 'painting' can be acceptable in this sentence. The Korean sentence '나는 그림을 그리고 있어' can imply creating a picture by drawing or painting, and in English, both 'I'm drawing a picture' and 'I'm painting a picture' are natural, while 'making a picture' is not commonly used to describe the act of creating art in this context.",,,
2,10540,he,,,,,,
2,10541,Yes,,,"The phrase 'Yes, please!' is a common and natural expression used to accept an offer or request politely. 'No' or 'Maybe' do not carry the same conventional usage in this context.",,,
2,10542,Help,,,,,,
2,10543,this,that,,"Both 'this' and 'that' can be used appropriately to ask about a price, depending on the distance or emphasis. 'This' is used for an item that is close to the speaker, while 'that' is used for an item that is further away. 'Them' is incorrect here as it is plural and does not grammatically fit in the singular context of the sentence.",,,

2,10545,firefighter,,,,,,
2,10546,doctor,,,,,,
2,10547,great,fine,,"Both 'great' and 'fine' correctly convey a positive state of feeling which aligns with the Korean expression '기분이 좋아요'. 'Great' expresses an enthusiastic and strong positive emotion, while 'fine' expresses a more neutral positive state. The word 'bad' is inconsistent with the meaning of the quiz, so it is not considered.",,,

2,10550,know,,,,,,
2,10551,Who,,,,,,
2,10552,kind,,,,,,
2,10553,Don’t,,,The sentence is a command to refrain from touching something. 'Don't touch that' is the standard negative imperative. The other options do not form a natural or grammatically correct command.,,,
2,10554,Listen,,,,,,
2,10555,Let’s go,,,,,,
2,10556,Sorry,,,,,,
2,10557,drawing,,,,,,
2,10558,drawing,,,,,,
2,10559,Do you,,,The phrase 'Do you' is the correct choice because the sentence 'Do you know what time it is?' is a standard and natural way of asking for the time. 'Are you' does not grammatically fit and 'Can you' does not naturally convey the intended meaning.,,,
2,10560,It’s time,,,,,,

2,10562,toy,,,,,,
2,10563,on,,,,,,

2,10565,that’s,,,"The contraction 'that's' (short for 'that is') fits naturally in the response 'Yes, that's mine.' It correctly indicates possession and is the commonly used phrase in such contexts. In contrast, 'this is' and 'those are' do not match as naturally with the demonstrative reference intended in the sentence.",,,

2,10569,go,,,,,,
2,10570,What,,,,,,
2,10571,come,,,,,,
2,10572,spelling,,,"The correct option is 'spelling' because the sentence is asking for the letters that make up the name. 'Version' and 'format' don't accurately refer to the individual letters of a name, whereas 'spelling' directly addresses the correct interpretation of the question.",,,
2,10573,preferred,,,The word 'preferred' is appropriate because it naturally completes the sentence by indicating the subject someone most likes. 'Loved' and 'enjoyed' do not grammatically fit in this context.,,,
2,10574,various,,,,,,
2,10575,borrow,use,,"Both 'borrow' and 'use' fit naturally in the sentence when asking for permission regarding someone else's pen. 
 
 1. 'Borrow' is a common expression when requesting to temporarily take and then return an item (which aligns with the idea of using someone's pen).
 2. 'Use' is also acceptable as it implies seeking permission to utilize the pen. 
 
 However, 'take' is inappropriate because it generally implies removing an item permanently or without permission. Thus, both 'borrow' and 'use' are suitable answers.",,,
2,10576,My pleasure,,,,,,
2,10577,umbrella,,,"The Korean sentence '이거 누구의 우산이야?' translates to 'Whose umbrella is this?'. Thus, 'umbrella' is the word that correctly matches the given context, while 'pen' and 'book' do not correspond with the translation.",,,
2,10578,sure,certain,,"Both 'sure' and 'certain' fit naturally in the sentence ""Are you ___ about this?"". 'Sure' is the most common colloquial expression used in this context, matching the informal nature of the conversation. 'Certain' also conveys confidence and assurance, making it a valid alternative. 'Definite' is not suitable because it is not typically used to ask or affirm certainty in this context.",,,
2,10579,explore,visit,,"Both 'explore' and 'visit' can be seen as natural choices in this context. 'Explore' directly resonates with the Korean phrase '탐험해보는', suggesting the idea of a more immersive or investigative experience of the museum. 'Visit' is also acceptable as it conveys the meaning of going to a museum, although it might imply a more general action. 'Avoid' does not fit the context since it is contrary to the intended meaning of having fun at the museum.",,,
2,10580,find,,,,,,
2,10581,try,,,"The sentence in Korean asks what one would like to 'try' immediately. The verb 'try' aligns with the concept of making an attempt, which fits perfectly with the intended meaning of '시도해보고 싶어'. 'Play' would typically be used in contexts involving games or sports, and 'do' is too generic without specifying an action. Therefore, 'try' is the most suitable answer.",,,
2,10582,play,,,"The Korean sentence '오늘은 놀고 싶지 않아' translates to 'I don't want to play today.' Therefore, 'play' is the correct answer because it directly matches the meaning of '놀다' in Korean.",,,
2,10583,amazing,,,,,,
2,10584,relaxed,,,,,,
2,10585,8,,,,,,
2,10586,5,3,7,"All three numeric options are valid times in this context. The sentence 'Would you like to meet at ___ o'clock?' is asking for a time to meet, and in everyday conversation, choosing any hour (5, 3, or 7 o'clock) would be acceptable. Therefore, each of the provided choices could logically fill the blank.",,,
2,10587,cost,price,,"Both 'cost' and 'price' refer to the monetary value of an item, which aligns with the Korean sentence asking about the book's price. 'Cost' is often used to denote how much something costs, and 'price' directly refers to the selling amount. 'Amount' is less appropriate because it typically refers to a quantity of something rather than a monetary price.",,,
2,10588,assist,help,,"Both 'assist' and 'help' appropriately complete the sentence. 'Help' is a common, natural choice in customer service contexts (e.g., 'Can I help you with your purchase?'), while 'assist' is a more formal alternative that fits equally well. 'Support' is less common in this specific context of offering help with a purchase, as it usually implies a different kind of aid.",,,
2,10589,find,reach,,"Both 'find' and 'reach' work naturally in the sentence. 'Find' implies discovering or locating the park, which fits the context of someone looking for directions. 'Reach' refers to getting to or arriving at the park, which also matches the intended meaning of the question. 'Locate' is less common in casual conversation when asking for directions, making 'find' and 'reach' the more suitable choices.",,,
2,10590,repeat,,,,,,
2,10591,She,,,,,,
2,10592,blue shoes,,,,,,
2,10593,works as,,,"The sentence 'Who works as a doctor?' correctly asks which person is employed in the role of a doctor. 'Does' does not fit because it does not indicate employment, and 'seems' does not logically match the Korean sentence asking about someone’s occupation.",,,
2,10594,talented,,,,,,
2,10595,everything,,,,,,
2,10596,about,,,,,,
2,10597,living,,,"The sentence 'He's in the ___ room.' suggests that the room is the living room as indicated by the Korean translation '거실'. The option 'living' most directly corresponds to 'living room' in this context, while 'bed' and 'office' do not match the provided Korean meaning.",,,
2,10598,helping,,,"The option 'helping' fits naturally with the sentence 'Would you mind ___ me out?' as it asks for assistance, which aligns with the Korean meaning '저를 도와주실 수 있나요?'. The other options, 'harming' and 'ignoring', do not make sense in this context.",,,
2,10599,To whom,,,,,,
2,10600,pen,,,,,,
2,10601,have a picnic,,,,,,
2,10602,reached,,,"The word 'reached' is the most appropriate because the message 'Hello, you've reached ~.' is typically used in telephone greetings to indicate that the call has been connected. 'Answered' and 'returned' do not convey the correct context of a successfully established connection.",,,
2,10603,want,,,,,,
2,10604,gift,,,,,,
2,10605,teacher,,,,,,
2,10606,clue,idea,,"Both 'clue' and 'idea' are commonly used in the expression 'I have no ___' to indicate a complete lack of understanding, which matches the Korean meaning '나는 전혀 모르겠어.' The phrase 'I have no idea' and 'I have no clue' are idiomatic expressions used to convey not knowing anything about a subject. 'Plan' does not fit the context of the sentence.",,,
2,10607,go to bed,,,,,,
2,10608,Nice,,,,,,
2,10609,come,,,,,,
2,10610,later,soon,,"Both 'later' and 'soon' can be used naturally in the phrase 'See you ______!'. 'See you later' is a common farewell, and 'See you soon' directly reflects the Korean '곧 봐요!' indicating that the meeting will occur in the near future. 'Yesterday' is not appropriate in this context.",,,
2,10611,visited,,,,,,
2,10612,had,,,,,,
2,10613,curly,,,"The Korean sentence describes hair that is curly (곱슬머리), so 'curly' is the term that matches accurately. 'Straight' would mean 곧은 머리 and 'bald' means no hair.",,,
2,10614,dressed,,,,,,
2,10615,running,,,,,,
2,10616,content,,,,,,
2,10617,What's the price,How much,,"Both 'What's the price' and 'How much' work naturally as they inquire about the cost of the watch. 'What's the price' directly asks for the cost, and 'How much' is a concise way to ask about the monetary value. 'How many dollars' is less appropriate because it specifically requires a numerical answer and is not the typical phrasing for asking about price in everyday conversation.",,,
2,10618,May I,,,"The sentence is asking for permission to use the computer. 'May I' is the most appropriate form for seeking permission because it is the standard, formal way to ask for approval. Although 'Can I' is used informally in spoken English, 'May I' is more grammatically correct in this context. 'Should I' is used to ask for advice rather than permission.",,,

2,10625,called,,,"The phrase 'What are they called?' is the most natural and commonly used expression when asking for the name of objects. Although 'named' could be considered in some contexts, it is less common in this particular sentence structure, and 'titled' is typically reserved for referring to the name of creative works rather than to objects like books.",,,
2,10626,understand,,,,,,
2,10627,Could,,,,,,
2,10628,problem,,,"The expression 'No problem. Anytime.' is a common idiom in English that matches the Korean '문제 없어요. 언제든지.' Although 'trouble' might seem similar, the standard and natural phrase is 'No problem,' while 'No time' does not make sense in this context.",,,
2,10629,owns,,,,,,
2,10630,thick,,,,,,
2,10631,prefer,,,"The Korean sentence translates to 'I like math more', indicating a positive preference towards math. Among the options, only 'prefer' expresses a liking or favoring, making it the correct choice.",,,
2,10632,sketching,,,,,,
2,10633,wake,,,,,,
2,10634,very,quite,,"Both 'very' and 'quite' fit naturally into the sentence structure. 'Very early' is a common intensifier used to emphasize the earliness, while 'quite early' is also acceptable and commonly used, particularly in British English, to indicate that something is notably early. 'Somewhat early' is less commonly used in this context, making 'very' and 'quite' the best choices.",,,

2,10642,Shall I,,,"The phrase 'Shall I' best captures the polite offer implied by the Korean sentence 제가 도와드릴까요?, which is a suggestion of help, making it the most natural fit. 'Can I' often asks for permission, and 'Will I' is not typically used in this context.",,,
2,10643,bedroom,,,,,,
2,10644,toy,,,,,,
2,10645,visit,,,,,,
2,10646,excellent,,,"The Korean sentence expresses high praise, implying that the idea is very good. 'Excellent' aligns with this positive meaning, unlike 'terrible' which is negative and 'mediocre' which suggests something average.",,,

2,10648,because,,,,,,
2,10649,country,,,,,,
2,10650,Good,,,,,,
2,10651,relax,,,"The Korean sentence '나는 항상 휴식을 취해요.' translates to 'I always take a break' or 'I always relax,' which fits naturally with the option 'relax.' The other options do not match the meaning of taking a break.",,,
2,10652,plans,,,,,,
2,10653,borrow,,,,,,
2,10654,Feel,,,,,,
2,10655,owns,has,,"Both 'owns' and 'has' work naturally in the sentence. 'Owns' clearly indicates ownership, which aligns with the Korean hint about possession, while 'has' is also commonly used to ask about who is in possession of something. 'Holds' is less appropriate in this context, making 'owns' and 'has' the correct choices.",,,

2,10665,bake,,,"The Korean sentence '나는 빵 굽는 것을 즐긴다' translates to 'I enjoy baking,' which makes 'bake' the correct fit for the blank in the English sentence 'I enjoy __.' The other options do not correspond with the activity described in Korean.",,,
2,10666,find,,,"The Korean sentence '도서관 안에서 책들을 찾을 수 있어' translates to 'You can find books inside the library'. This directly indicates that the intended word is 'find', which means to search for or discover something. The other options, 'draw' and 'see', do not match the intended meaning.",,,
2,10667,beautiful,,,"The word 'beautiful' directly translates to '아름답네' in the Korean sentence and fits naturally in the exclamation 'How beautiful this garden is!'. 'Colorful' would emphasize color rather than beauty, and 'dull' contradicts the positive comment in the Korean sentence.",,,

2,10678,concert,game,,"Both 'concert' and 'game' refer to events that are typically scheduled for a specific date, matching the Korean term '행사' (event). 'Concert' is a common event that people attend, and 'game' is also an event (such as a sports game) with a set date. 'Lecture' is less likely since it is usually not referred to as '행사' in this context.",,,
2,10679,come,,,"The phrase 'Could you come to my birthday party?' is the standard and most natural way to invite someone. The option 'come' matches the invitation context, where the host typically uses 'come' rather than 'go' or 'enter', making it the best choice.",,,
2,10680,study,travel,sleep,"All three options can grammatically complete the sentence ""Yes, I will ___ tomorrow."" in a natural way. 
 
 1. 'Study' fits because it indicates an academic or learning activity.
 2. 'Travel' is a common activity that matches the inquiry in the Korean question asking about plans for tomorrow.
 3. 'Sleep' also fits as a potential activity, as the sentence structure allows any appropriate verb that expresses an action planned for the future.
 
 Given the open-ended nature of the Korean sentence (""내일 뭐 할 거야?"", which translates to ""What will you do tomorrow?""), all three options are acceptable choices.",,,
2,10681,That's,,,"Using the contraction 'That's' fits naturally in the sentence 'That's a great suggestion!' and is the common way to express an immediate reaction to a suggestion. 'That was' implies a past event, while 'Those are' is grammatically incorrect for referring to a singular suggestion.",,,
2,10682,walk,,,,,,
2,10683,near,,,,,,
2,10684,May I offer you something?,Can I get you anything?,,"Both 'May I offer you something?' and 'Can I get you anything?' are commonly used when offering assistance in a polite manner, matching the context of a service setting where someone is asked if they need something. 'Do I get you something?' is less natural in this context.",,,
2,10685,sour,,,,,,
2,10686,faster,,,,,,
2,10687,I disagree with,,,"The Korean sentence indicates a contrast that implies disagreement with his plan. Among the options, 'I disagree with' directly expresses opposition, matching the meaning of '반대해'. 'I agree with' and 'I support' indicate approval rather than disagreement.",,,

2,10701,works,,,,,,
2,10702,market,,,"Since the Korean sentence specifically mentions '시장' which means 'market', the correct choice is 'market'. 'Bank' and 'mall' do not match the Korean indication of the destination.",,,

2,10712,enjoy,love,prefer,"All three options can be used to complete the sentence depending on the nuance the speaker wishes to convey:
 
 1. 'Enjoy' fits well as it implies taking pleasure in the season and matches the natural consequence of the flowers blooming.
 2. 'Love' strongly expresses affection and preference, fitting the question 'Which season do you like most?'.
 3. 'Prefer' indicates a choice among seasons and also logically fits when stating a reason for the preference.
 
 Thus, each option is acceptable and could be considered a correct answer.",,,

2,10719,"Would you repeat that, please? Pardon?","Could you repeat that, please? Pardon?",,"Both 'Would you repeat that, please? Pardon?' and 'Could you repeat that, please? Pardon?' directly ask for repetition, which directly corresponds with the Korean sentence asking to have something repeated. The phrase 'repeat that' is appropriate for the request '다시 한 번 말씀해 주시겠어요?' while the option using 'explain' changes the meaning to asking for clarification rather than repetition.",,,
2,10720,planning,going,,Both 'planning' and 'going' naturally complete the sentence. 'What are you planning to do later?' and 'What are you going to do later?' are common ways to ask about someone's future activities. 'Willing' does not fit as naturally since it implies a readiness rather than a planned action.,,,

2,10727,speak with,talk to,ask for,"All three options can naturally complete the sentence in a telephone context. 
 
 1. 'Speak with' is a common collocation used when requesting a conversation with someone, fitting the context of calling for the manager.
 2. 'Talk to' is similarly used to indicate having a conversation, which is appropriate in this situation.
 3. 'Ask for' is often used in telephonic requests, as in 'Can I ask for the manager?', making it a valid option as well.
 
 Thus, all three options are acceptable answers.",,,
2,10728,date,,,,,,
2,10729,can't wait,,,"The phrase 'can't wait' is an idiomatic expression commonly used to express great excitement or eagerness for something that is about to happen, which directly matches the intended meaning in both the English sentence and the Korean sentence.

'I'll have' is a direct and natural way to place an order, and 'I'd like' is a polite alternative. 'I want' is grammatically correct but sounds less polite and is not as commonly used in ordering food in a restaurant context.",,,

The Korean sentence expresses astonishment and admiration ('정말 놀라워! 얼마나 인상적이야!'), and both adjectives capture that sense. 'Impressive' directly translates to 인상적, while 'amazing' conveys a similar sentiment of surprise and admiration. 'Ordinary' does not fit the context.",,,

2,10754,restaurant,museum,bank,"All three provided options (restaurant, museum, bank) are valid as they all represent locations that one might ask directions to. The Korean sentence '저에게 도착지까지의 길을 알려주세요' (please tell me the way to the destination) does not specify a particular type of place, so any of these options can grammatically and contextually complete the sentence.",,,
2,10755,beside,,,,,,
2,10756,going to,planning to,,"Both 'going to' and 'planning to' properly indicate a future intention or plan, which fits the context of asking about what someone will do this weekend. 'Thinking of' would require an extra 'doing' ('thinking of doing') to be grammatically correct, so it is not suitable.",,,
2,10757,talk,speak,,"Both 'talk' and 'speak' fit naturally in the sentence 'May I ___ to him?'.
 
 1. 'Speak' is a common and formal way to ask for verbal contact, which aligns well with the Korean phrase meaning 'to have a conversation with him'.
 2. 'Talk' is also grammatically correct when followed by 'to him' and conveys the same meaning.
 3. The option 'call' would generally be used without the preposition 'to', as in 'May I call him?', so it doesn't fit the given sentence structure.
 
 Thus, both 'talk' and 'speak' are appropriate choices.",,,

2,10760,How often,How frequently,,"Both 'How often' and 'How frequently' are commonly used to ask about the frequency of an activity, directly matching the Korean phrase '얼마나 자주'. They naturally fit into the sentence structure '___ do you read books?' and convey the intended meaning. On the other hand, 'How regularly' is less frequently used in this context, making it a less suitable choice.",,,
2,10761,amazing,awesome,,"Both 'amazing' and 'awesome' can be used to compliment someone's performance as described in the Korean sentence. The Korean sentence implies that the person did something surprisingly good, which can be conveyed by either 'amazing' or 'awesome.' 'Ordinary' does not convey this positive emphasis and is therefore not suitable.",,,

2,10764,agree,,,"The sentence 'Do you ______ with him?' asks if the speaker shares the same opinion or concurs with him. 'Agree' fits naturally in this context, as it directly translates the intended meaning from the Korean phrase '동의하니?' and matches the response 'Yes, I do.' The other options 'argue' and 'disagree' do not convey agreement.",,,
2,10765,In my opinion,,,"The phrase 'In my opinion' directly translates to '내 생각에는,' which best fits the sentence in both meaning and natural English usage. 'Honestly' is typically used to emphasize sincerity rather than an opinion, and 'According to me' is grammatically awkward in English.",,,

2,10768,must,should,,"Both 'must' and 'should' can express an obligation or duty to protect the environment. 'Must' conveys a strong, compulsory necessity, while 'should' implies a recommended or advised action. Since the Korean statement '우리는 환경을 보호해야 해요' can be interpreted as either an imperative or a recommendation, both options are acceptable.",,,
